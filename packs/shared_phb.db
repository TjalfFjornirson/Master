{"name":"06 Chapter 5.9: Mounts and Vehicles","permission":{"default":0,"DJNYgTCLxATVgLjS":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":1800000}},"content":"<h2>Mounts and Vehicles</h2><div><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/731/c511.jpg\"></p><p>A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal’s speed and base carrying capacity.</p><p>An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.</p><p>Mounts other than those listed here are available in the worlds of D&amp;D, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.</p><p><strong>Barding.</strong> Barding is armor designed to protect an animal’s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table in this chapter can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.</p><p><strong>Saddles.</strong> A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount.</p><p><strong>Vehicle Proficiency.</strong> If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.</p><p><strong>Rowed Vessels.</strong> Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land.</p><h3>Mounts</h3><div><table class=\"compendium-gear-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Item</th>\n<th

They’re individuals with their own stories, interests, connections, and capabilities beyond those that class and race define. This chapter expounds on the details that distinguish characters from one another, including the basics of name and physical description, the rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer points of personality and alignment.</p><h2>Character Details</h2><p>Your character’s name and physical description might be the first things that the other players at the table learn about you. It’s worth thinking about how these characteristics reflect the character you have in mind.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>TIKA AND ARTEMIS: CONTRASTING CHARACTERS</strong></p>\n<p>The details in this chapter make a big difference in setting your character apart from every other character. Consider the following two human fighters.</p>\n<p>Hailing from the Dragonlance setting, Tika Waylan was a brash teenager who had a rough childhood. The daughter of a thief, she ran away from home and practiced her father’s trade on the streets of Solace. When she tried to rob the proprietor of the Inn of the Last Home, he caught her and took her under his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid. But when the dragonarmies laid waste to the town of Solace and destroyed the inn, necessity forced Tika into adventure alongside the friends she’d known from her childhood. Her skill as a fighter (a frying pan remains one of her favorite weapons) combined with her history on the streets gave her skills invaluable in her adventuring career.</p>\n<p>Artemis Entreri grew up on the streets of Calimport in the Forgotten Realms. He used his wits, strength, and agility to carve out his own territory in one of the city’s hundreds of poor shanty towns. After several years, he attracted the notice of one of the most powerful thieves’ guilds in the city, and he ascended the ranks of the guild quickly despite his youth. Artemis became the favored assassin of one of the city’s pashas, who sent him to far-off Icewind Dale to recover some stolen gems. He’s a professional killer, constantly challenging himself to improve his skills.</p>\n<p>Tika and Artemis are both human and both fighters (with some experience as rogues), possessing similarly high Strength and Dexterity scores, but there the similarity ends.</p>\n</blockquote><h3>Name</h3><p>Your character’s race description includes sample names for members of that race. Put some thought into your name even if you’re just picking one from a list.</p><h3>Sex</h3><p>You can play a male or female character without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your character does or does not conform to the broader culture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior. For example, a male drow cleric defies the traditional gender divisions of drow society, which could be a reason for your character to leave that society and come to the surface.</p><p>You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is often seen as androgynous, for example, and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon’s image. You could also play a female character who presents herself as a man, a man who feels trapped in a female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character’s sexual orientation is for you to decide.</p><h4>Height and Weight</h4><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Race</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Base<br>Height</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Height<br>Modifier</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Base<br>Weight</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Weight<br>Modifier</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Human</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4'8\"</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+2d10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">110 lb.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">× (2d4) lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Dwarf, hill</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">3'8\"</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+2d4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">115 lb.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">× (2d6) lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Dwarf, mountain</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4'</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+2d4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">130 lb.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">× (2d6) lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Elf, high</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4'6\"</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+2d10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">90 lb.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">× (1d4) lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Elf, wood</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4'6\"</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+2d10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">100 lb.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">× (1d4) lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Elf, drow</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4'5\"</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+2d6</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">75 lb.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">× (1d6) lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Halfling</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2'7\"</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+2d4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">35 lb.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">× 1 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Dragonborn</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">5'6\"</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+2d8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">175 lb.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">× (2d6) lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Gnome</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2'11\"</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+2d4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">35 lb.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">× 1 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Half-elf</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4'9\"</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+2d8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">110 lb.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">× (2d4) lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Half-orc</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4'10\"</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+2d10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">140 lb.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">× (2d6) lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Tiefling</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4'9\"</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+2d8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">110 lb.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">× (2d4) lb.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p><br>You can decide your character’s height and weight, using the information provided in your race description or on the Random Height and Weight table. Think about what your character’s ability scores might say about his or her height and weight. A weak but agile character might be thin. A strong and tough character might be tall or just heavy.</p><p>If you want to, you can roll randomly for your character’s height and weight using the Random Height and Weight table. The dice roll given in the Height Modifier column determines the character’s extra height (in inches) beyond the base height. That same number multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in the Weight Modifier column determines the character’s extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight.</p><p>For example, as a human, Tika has a height of 4 feet 8 inches plus 2d10 inches. Her player rolls 2d10 and gets a total of 12, so Tika stands 5 feet 8 inches tall. Then the player uses that same roll of 12 and multiplies it by 2d4 pounds. Her 2d4 roll is 3, so Tika weighs an extra 36 pounds (12 × 3) on top of her base 110 pounds, for a total of 146 pounds.</p><h3>Other Physical Characteristics</h3><p>You choose your character’s age and the color of his or her hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of distinctiveness, you might want to give your character an unusual or memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, or a tattoo.</p><blockquote><strong>TIKA AND ARTEMIS: CHARACTER DETAILS<br><br></strong>Consider how the names Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri set these characters apart from each other and reflect their personalities. Tika is a young woman determined to prove that she’s not just a kid any more, and her name makes her sound young and ordinary. Artemis Entreri comes from an exotic land and carries a more mysterious name.</blockquote><p>Tika is nineteen years old at the start of her adventuring career and has auburn hair, green eyes, fair skin with freckles, and a mole on her right hip. Artemis is a small man, compact and all wiry muscle. He has angular features and high cheekbones, and he always seems in need of a shave. His raven-black hair is thick and full, but his eyes are gray and lifeless — betraying the emptiness of his life and soul.</p><h3>Alignment</h3><p>A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.</p><p>These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.</p><p><strong>Lawful good</strong> (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.</p><p><strong>Neutral good</strong> (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.</p><p><strong>Chaotic good</strong> (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.</p><p><strong>Lawful neutral</strong> (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.</p><p><strong>Neutral</strong> (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.</p><p><strong>Chaotic neutral</strong> (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.</p><p><strong>Lawful evil</strong> (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.</p><p><strong>Neutral evil</strong> (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil.</p><p><strong>Chaotic evil</strong> (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.</p><div>\n<h4 id=\"AlignmentintheMultiverse\" class=\"quick-menu-exclude\">Alignment in the Multiverse</h4>\n<p>For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.</p>\n<p>The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god’s influence.)</p>\n<p>Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.</p>\n<p>Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments — they are <strong>unaligned</strong>. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>TIKA AND ARTEMIS: ALIGNMENT</strong></p>\n<p>Tika Waylan is neutral good, fundamentally good-hearted and striving to help others where she can. Artemis is lawful evil, unconcerned with the value of sentient life but at least professional in his approach to murder.</p>\n<p>As an evil character, Artemis is not an ideal adventurer. He began his career as a villain, and only cooperates with heroes when he must — and when it’s in his own best interests. In most games, evil adventurers cause problems in groups alongside others who don’t share their interests and objectives. Generally, evil alignments are for villains and monsters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"Languages\">Languages</h3>\n</div><div>\n<p>Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.</p>\n<p>Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose one that is common in your campaign. With your DM’s permission, you can instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret language, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids.</p>\n<h4 id=\"DwarvishAlphabet\">Dwarvish Alphabet</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/663/c4dwarvishalphabet.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Some of these languages are actually families of languages with many dialects.

Four categories of characteristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character’s favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.</p>\n<p>Each background presented in this chapter includes suggested characteristics that you can use to spark your imagination. You’re not bound to those options, but they’re a good starting point.</p>\n<h4 id=\"PersonalityTraits\">Personality Traits</h4>\n<p>Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character. They should be self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out. “I’m smart” is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every book in Candlekeep” tells you something specific about your character’s interests and disposition.</p>\n<p>Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character’s self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.</p>\n<p>A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Ideals\">Ideals</h4>\n<p>Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system.</p>\n<p>Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing you strive for?</p>\n<p>You can choose any ideals you like, but your character’s alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background in this chapter includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last one has more to do with the particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Bonds\">Bonds</h4>\n<p>Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character’s connections to people, places, and events in the world. They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character’s motivations and goals.</p>\n<p>Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection? What is your most treasured possession?</p>\n<p>Your bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your race, or some other aspect of your character’s history or personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your adventures.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Flaws\">Flaws</h4>\n<p>Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character’s flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness — in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests. More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you? What’s the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>TIKA AND ARTEMIS: PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS</strong></p>\n<p>Tika and Artemis have distinct personality traits. Tika Waylan dislikes boastfulness and has a fear of heights resulting from a bad fall during her career as a thief. Artemis Entreri is always prepared for the worst and moves with a quick, precise confidence.</p>\n<p>Consider their ideals. Tika Waylan is innocent, almost childlike, believing in the value of life and the importance of appreciating everyone. Neutral good in alignment, she cleaves to ideals of life and respect. Artemis Entreri never allows his emotions to master him, and he constantly challenges himself to improve his skills. His lawful evil alignment gives him ideals of impartiality and a lust for power.</p>\n<p>Tika Waylan’s bond is to the Inn of the Last Home. The inn’s proprietor gave her a new chance at life, and her friendship with her adventuring companions was forged during her time working there. Its destruction by the marauding dragonarmies gives Tika a very personal reason to hate them with a fiery passion. Her bond might be phrased as “I will do whatever it takes to punish the dragonarmies for the destruction of the Inn of the Last Home.”</p>\n<p>Artemis Entreri’s bond is a strange, almost paradoxical relationship with Drizzt Do’Urden, his equal in swordplay and grim determination. In his first battle with Drizzt, Artemis recognized something of himself in his opponent, some indication that if his life had gone differently, he might have led a life more like the heroic drow’s. From that moment, Artemis is more than a criminal assassin — he is an antihero, driven by his rivalry with Drizzt. His bond might be phrased as “I will not rest until I have proved myself better than Drizzt Do’Urden.”</p>\n<p>Each of these characters also has an important flaw. Tika Waylan is naive and emotionally vulnerable, younger than her companions and annoyed that they still think of her as the kid they knew years ago. She might even be tempted to act against her principles if she’s convinced that a particular achievement would demonstrate her maturity. Artemis Entreri is completely walled off from any personal relationship and just wants to be left alone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><h2>Inspiration</h2><p>Inspiration is a rule the game master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that’s true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you.</p><h3>Gaining Inspiration</h3><p>Your DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your DM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.</p><p>You either have inspiration or you don’t - you can’t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.</p><h3>Using Inspiration</h3><p>If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.</p><p>Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.</p><h2>Backgrounds</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/650/c4-1.jpg\"></p><p>Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.</p><p>Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?</p><p>The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><p>Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described in chapter 7, \"<a title=\"Using Ability Scores\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/using-ability-scores#AbilityChecks\">Using Ability Scores</a>\").</p><p>In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools (detailed in chapter 5, \"<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>\").</p><p>If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.</p><h3>Additional Languages</h3><p>Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See “<a title=\"Languages\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/personality-and-background#Languages\">Languages</a>” earlier in this chapter.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule from <a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment\">chapter 5</a>&nbsp;to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.</p><h3>Suggested Characteristics</h3><p>A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.</p><h3>Customizing a Background</h3><p>You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in <a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment\">chapter 5</a>. (If you spend coin, you can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your DM to create one.</p><aside>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>TIKA AND ARTEMIS: BACKGROUNDS</strong></p>\n<p>Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri both lived their earliest years as street urchins.

Common sense should steer people away from things that sound too good to be true, but common sense seems to be in short supply when you’re around.

At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SuggestedCharacteristics\" class=\"quick-menu-exclude\">Suggested Characteristics</h4>\n<p>Successful entertainers have to be able to capture and hold an audience’s attention, so they tend to have flamboyant or forceful personalities.

This kind of flashy combat is your entertainer routine, though you might also have some skills as a tumbler or actor. Using your By Popular Demand feature, you can find a place to perform in any place that features combat for entertainment — perhaps a gladiatorial arena or secret pit fighting club.

However, your guild might instead be a loose network of artisans who each work in a different village within a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your guild. You can select your guild business from the Guild Business table or roll randomly.</p>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\"><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1849648607\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[wQlP5oLAqe0aePqZ]{Guild Business}</span></div></div></div>\n<p>As a member of your guild, you know the skills needed to create finished items from raw materials (reflected in your proficiency with a certain kind of artisan’s tools), as well as the principles of trade and good business practices. The question now is whether you abandon your trade for adventure, or take on the extra effort to weave adventuring and trade together.</p>\n<h4 id=\"FeatureGuildMembership\" class=\"quick-menu-exclude\">Feature: Guild Membership</h4>\n<p>As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.</p>\n<p>Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild’s coffers.</p>\n<p>You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild’s good graces.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SuggestedCharacteristics\" class=\"quick-menu-exclude\">Suggested Characteristics</h4>\n<p>Guild artisans are among the most ordinary people in the world — until they set down their tools and take up an adventuring career.

You don’t craft items yourself but earn a living by buying and selling the works of others (or the raw materials artisans need to practice their craft). Your guild might be a large merchant consortium (or family) with interests across the region. Perhaps you transported goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold them in your own little shop. In some ways, the traveling merchant’s life lends itself to adventure far more than the life of an artisan.</p>\n<p>Rather than proficiency with artisan’s tools, you might be proficient with navigator’s tools or an additional language. And instead of artisan’s tools, you can start with a mule and a cart.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Hermit\" class=\"compendium-hr\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/backgrounds/hermit\">Hermit</a></h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/656/c4bg6.png\"></p>\n<p>You lived in seclusion — either in a sheltered community such as a monastery, or entirely alone — for a formative part of your life.

The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.</p>\n<p>Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SuggestedCharacteristics\" class=\"quick-menu-exclude\">Suggested Characteristics</h4>\n<p>Some hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion, whereas others chafe against it and long for company. Whether they embrace solitude or long to escape it, the solitary life shapes their attitudes and ideals.

If you want to play a rugged wilderness recluse who lives off the land while shunning the company of other people, look at the outlander background. On the other hand, if you want to go in a more religious direction, the acolyte might be what you’re looking for. Or you could even be a charlatan, posing as a wise and holy person and letting pious fools support you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Noble\" class=\"compendium-hr\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/backgrounds/noble\">Noble</a></h3>\n<p>You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p>\n<p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own — it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p>\n<p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?</p>\n<p>What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</p>\n<p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?</p>\n<p>These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.</p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Skill Proficiencies:</span> <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#History\">History</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Persuasion\">Persuasion</a></p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Tool Proficiencies:</span> One type of gaming set</p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Languages:</span> One of your choice</p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Equipment:</span> A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a scroll of pedigree, and a purse containing 25 gp</p>\n<h4 id=\"FeaturePositionofPrivilege\" class=\"quick-menu-exclude\">Feature: Position of Privilege</h4>\n<p>Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SuggestedCharacteristics\" class=\"quick-menu-exclude\">Suggested Characteristics</h4>\n<p>Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds — responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family’s care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.</p>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\"><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1849648638\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[J21soioMluDdjIr1]{Personality Trait}</span></div></div></div>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\"><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1849648639\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[K7LMsRTfxoCE6hzW]{Ideal}</span></div></div></div>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\"><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1849648640\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[1DQDRRRe0ajMrKHT]{Bond}</span></div></div></div>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\"><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1849648641\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[6BKy20SOC96mfmRH]{Flaw}</span></div></div></div>\n<h4 id=\"VariantNobleKnight\" class=\"quick-menu-exclude\">Variant Noble: <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/backgrounds/knight\">Knight</a></h4>\n<p>A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature (see the sidebar) instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps you put it on).</p>\n<p>As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart — in a chaste sort of devotion. (This person could be your bond.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>VARIANT FEATURE: RETAINERS</strong></p>\n<p>If your character has a noble background, you may select this background feature instead of Position of Privilege.</p>\n<p>You have the service of three retainers loyal to your family. These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo.

If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.</p><p><strong>Armor Class (AC).</strong> Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.</p><p><strong>Heavy Armor.</strong> Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows \"Str 13\" or \"Str 15\" in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.</p><p><strong>Stealth.</strong> If the Armor table shows \"Disadvantage\" in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth\">Stealth</a>) checks.</p><p><strong>Shields.</strong> A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.</p><h3>Light Armor</h3><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"armorname\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Armor Name</th>\n<th class=\"armorcost\">Cost</th>\n<th class=\"armorarmorClass\">Armor Class (AC)</th>\n<th class=\"armorstrength\">Strength</th>\n<th class=\"armorstealth\">Stealth</th>\n<th class=\"armorweight\">Weight</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Padded</td>\n<td>5 gp</td>\n<td>11 + Dex modifier</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>Disadvantage</td>\n<td>8 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Leather</td>\n<td>10 gp</td>\n<td>11 + Dex modifier</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>10 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Studded leather</td>\n<td>45 gp</td>\n<td>12 + Dex modifier</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>13 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p>&nbsp;Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.</p><p><strong>Padded.</strong> Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.</p><p><strong>Leather.</strong> The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.</p><p><strong>Studded Leather.</strong> Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.</p><h3>Medium Armor</h3><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"armorname\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Armor Name</th>\n<th class=\"armorcost\">Cost</th>\n<th class=\"armorarmorClass\">Armor Class (AC)</th>\n<th class=\"armorstrength\">Strength</th>\n<th class=\"armorstealth\">Stealth</th>\n<th class=\"armorweight\">Weight</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Hide</td>\n<td>10 gp</td>\n<td>12 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>12 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Chain shirt</td>\n<td>50 gp</td>\n<td>13 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>20 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Scale mail</td>\n<td>50 gp</td>\n<td>14 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>Disadvantage</td>\n<td>45 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Breastplate</td>\n<td>400 gp</td>\n<td>14 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>20 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Half plate</td>\n<td>750 gp</td>\n<td>15 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>Disadvantage</td>\n<td>40 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p>Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more.

It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.</p><p><strong>Chain Shirt.</strong> Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.</p><p><strong>Scale Mail.</strong> This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.</p><p><strong>Breastplate.</strong> This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.</p><p><strong>Half Plate.</strong> Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer's body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.</p><h3>Heavy Armor</h3><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"armorname\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Armor Name</th>\n<th class=\"armorcost\">Cost</th>\n<th class=\"armorarmorClass\">Armor Class (AC)</th>\n<th class=\"armorstrength\">Strength</th>\n<th class=\"armorstealth\">Stealth</th>\n<th class=\"armorweight\">Weight</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Ring mail</td>\n<td>30 gp</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>Disadvantage</td>\n<td>40 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Chain mail</td>\n<td>75 gp</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>Str 13</td>\n<td>Disadvantage</td>\n<td>55 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Splint</td>\n<td>200 gp</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>Str 15</td>\n<td>Disadvantage</td>\n<td>60 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Plate</td>\n<td>1,500 gp</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>Str 15</td>\n<td>Disadvantage</td>\n<td>65 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p>&nbsp;Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection.

Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.</p><p>Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.</p><p><strong>Ring Mail.</strong> This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can't afford better armor.</p><p><strong>Chain Mail.</strong> Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.</p><p><strong>Splint.</strong> This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.</p><p><strong>Plate.</strong> Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body.

It encompasses every world where Dungeon Masters run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.</p><p>Many spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater power and higher levels, you might undertake a quest to rescue a friend from the horrific depths of the Abyss, or find yourself hoisting a tankard with the friendly giants of Ysgard. You might walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.</p><h2>The Material Plane</h2><p>The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane matter. All the worlds of D&amp;D exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.</p><p>The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of the DMs who set their games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned.</p><p>The best-known worlds in the multiverse are the ones that have been published as official campaign settings for the D&amp;D game over the years — Greyhawk, Blackmoor, Dragonlance, the Forgotten Realms, Mystara, Birthright, Dark Sun, and Eberron, among others. Each of these worlds boasts its own cast of heroic adventurers and scheming villains, its own ancient ruins and forgotten artifacts, its own dungeons and its own dragons. But if your campaign takes place on one of these worlds, it belongs to your DM — you might imagine it as one of thousands of parallel versions of the world, which might diverge wildly from the published version.</p><h3>Material Echoes</h3><p>The Material Plane is a richly magical place, and its magical nature is reflected in the two planes that share its central place in the multiverse. The Feywild and the Shadowfell are parallel dimensions occupying the same cosmological space, so they are often called echo planes or mirror planes to the Material Plane. The worlds and landscapes of these planes mirror the natural world of the Material Plane but reflect those features into different forms—more marvelous and magical in the Feywild, distorted and colorless in the Shadowfell. Where a volcano stands in the Material Plane, a mountain topped with skyscraper-sized crystals that glow with internal fire towers in the Feywild, and a jagged rock outcropping resembling a skull marks the spot on the Shadowfell.</p><p>The<strong><span class=\"bold\"> Feywild</span></strong>, also called the Plane of Faerie, is a land of soft lights and wonder, a country of little people with great desires, a place of music and death. It is a realm of eternal twilight, with slow lanterns bobbing in the gentle breeze and huge fireflies buzzing through groves and fields. The sky is alight with the faded colors of the setting, or perhaps rising, sun. But, in fact, the sun never truly sets or rises; it remains stationary, dusky and low in the sky. Away from the settled areas ruled by the Seelie Court, the land is a tangle of sharp-toothed brambles and syrupy fens—perfect territory for the Unseelie to hunt their prey. Fey creatures, such as those brought to the world by <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/conjure-woodland-beings\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"conjure woodland beings\">conjure woodland beings</a> and similar spells, dwell in the Feywild.</p><p>The<strong><span class=\"bold\"> Shadowfell</span></strong>, also called the Plane of Shadow, is a darkly lighted dimension, a world of black and white where color has been leached from everything. It is a place of toxic darkness that hates the light, where the sky is a black vault with neither sun nor stars.</p><h2>Beyond the Material</h2><p>Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They’re not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.</p><h3>Planar Travel</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/745/appplanes1.png\"></p><p>When adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.</p><p>Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.</p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Spells. </span></strong>A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence. <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"Plane shift\">Plane shift</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gate\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"gate\">gate</a> can transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision. <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/etherealness\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"Etherealness\">Etherealness</a> allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches—the Shadowfell, the Feywild, or the Elemental Planes. And the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/astral-projection\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"astral projection\">astral projection</a> spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.</p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\"> Portals.</span></strong> A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations — circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns — that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).</p><div class=\"Basic-Text-Frame\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE PLANES</strong></p>\n<p>Like a dome above the other planes, the <span class=\"bold\">Positive Plane</span> is the source of radiant energy and the raw life force that suffuses all living beings, from the puny to the sublime. Its dark reflection is the <span class=\"bold\">Negative Plane</span>, the source of necrotic energy that destroys the living and animates the undead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><h3>Transitive Planes</h3><p>The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/etherealness\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"etherealness\">etherealness</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/astral-projection\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"astral projection\">astral projection</a> allow characters to enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.</p><p>The<strong><span class=\"bold\"> Ethereal Plane</span></strong> is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the <span class=\"italic\">see invisibility</span> and <span class=\"italic\">true seeing</span> spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/forcecage\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"forcecage\">forcecage</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wall-of-force\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"wall of force\">wall of force</a>. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.</p><p>The<strong><span class=\"bold\"> Astral Plane</span></strong> is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.</p><h3>Inner Planes</h3><p>The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all the worlds were made. The four <span class=\"bold\"><strong>Elemental Planes</strong>&nbsp;</span>— Air, Earth, Fire, and Water — form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the churning <strong><span class=\"bold\">Ele</span><span class=\"bold\">mental Chaos</span></strong>.</p><p>At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest form — great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.</p><h3>Outer Planes</h3><p>If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.</p><p>When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally “places” at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.</p><p>Even in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs.</p><p>Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day — if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.</p><p>The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between them.</p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/746/appplanes2.png\"></p><h4>Outer Planes</h4><div><table class=\"outer-planes-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-6\">\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Outer Plane</th>\n<th class=\"outer-planes-alignment-header\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Alignment</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-7\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Mount Celestia, the Seven Heavens of</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: left;\">LG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-8\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Bytopia, the Twin Paradises of</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">NG, LG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-7\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Elysium, the Blessed Fields of</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">NG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-8\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The Beastlands, the Wilderness of</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">NG, CG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-7\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Arborea, the Olympian Glades of</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">CG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-8\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Ysgard, the Heroic Domains of</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">CN, CG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-7\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Limbo, the Ever-Changing Chaos of</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">CN</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-8\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Pandemonium, the Windswept Depths of</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">CN, CE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-7\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The Abyss, the Infinite Layers of</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">CE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-8\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Carceri, the Tarterian Depths of</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">NE, CE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-7\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Hades, the Gray Waste of</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">NE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-8\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Gehenna, the Bleak Eternity of</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">NE, LE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-7\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The Nine Hells (of Baator)</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">LE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-8\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Acheron, the Infinite Battlefield of</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">LN, LE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-7\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Mechanus, the Clockwork Nirvana of</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">LN</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-8\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Arcadia, the Peaceable Kingdoms of</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">LN, LG</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p><br>The planes with some element of good in their nature are called the <strong><span class=\"bold\">Upper Planes</span></strong>. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the <strong><span class=\"bold\">Lower Planes</span></strong>. Fiends such as demons, devils, and yugoloths dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane’s alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn’t match the plane’s experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example, it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.</p><h3>Other Planes</h3><p>Existing somehow between or beyond the known planes of existence are a variety of other realms.</p><h3>Sigil and the Outlands</h3><p>The Outlands is the plane between the Outer Planes, a plane of neutrality, but not the neutrality of nothingness. Instead it incorporates a little of everything, keeping it all in a paradoxical balance—simultaneously concordant and in opposition. It is a broad region of varied terrain, with open prairies, towering mountains, and twisting, shallow rivers, strongly resembling an ordinary world of the Material Plane.</p><p>The Outlands is circular, like a great wheel—in fact, those who envision the Outer Planes as a wheel point to the Outlands as proof, calling it a microcosm of the planes. That argument might be circular, however, for it is possible that the arrangement of the Outlands inspired the idea of the Great Wheel in the first place.</p><p>Around the outside edge of the circle, evenly spaced, are the <strong><span class=\"bold\">gate-towns</span></strong>: sixteen settlements, each built around a portal leading to one of the Outer Planes. Each town shares many of the characteristics of the plane where its gate leads.</p><p>At the center of the Outlands, like the axle of the planar wheel, the Spire shoots impossibly high into the sky. Above this thin peak floats the ring-shaped city of Sigil, the City of Doors. This bustling planar metropolis holds countless portals to other planes and worlds.</p><p>Sigil is a trader’s city. Goods, merchandise, and information come to it from across the planes. There is a brisk trade in information about the planes, in particular in the command words or items required for the operation of particular portals. These portal keys are highly sought after, and many travelers within the city are looking for a particular portal or a portal key to allow them to continue on their way.</p><h3>Demiplanes</h3><p>Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don’t seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/demiplane\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"demiplane\">demiplane</a>, or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"plane shift\">plane shift</a></span> spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gate\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"gate\">gate</a></span> spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.</p><h3>The Far Realm</h3><p>The Far Realm is beyond the known multiverse. In fact, it might be an entirely separate multiverse with its own physical and magical laws. Where stray energies from the Far Realm leak onto another plane, life and matter are warped and twisted into alien shapes that defy ordinary geometry and biology.</p><p>The entities that abide in the Far Realm are too alien for a normal mind to accept without damage. Titanic creatures swim through nothingness, preoccupied with madness. Unspeakable things whisper awful truths to those who dare listen. For mortals, knowledge of the Far Realm is a triumph of mind over the rude boundaries of matter, space, and eventually sanity.</p><p>There are no known portals to the Far Realm, or at least none that are still viable. Ancient elves once pierced the boundary of eons with a vast portal to the Far Realm within a mountain called Firestorm Peak, but their civilization imploded in bloody terror and the portal’s location—even its home world—is long-forgotten. Other portals might still exist, marked by the alien forces leaking through to corrupt the Material Plane around them.</p>","img":null}

The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).</p><p>With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.</p><p>One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.</p><p>One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.</p><p>In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.</p><p>A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.</p><h4>Standard Exchange Rates</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1899063946\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[YNXaKrAgihX7doP2]{Coin: cp}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1899063945\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[mQTLUfxtFWMVphr7]{Coin: sp}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1899063944\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[FOLA5HzEYSswWf2n]{Coin: ep}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1899063943\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[lKzqn35CeURhyz7l]{Coin: gp}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1899063942\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[iOhMgMfrDiABYyxa]{Coin: pp}</span></div></div></div></div>","img":null,"_id":"ExYJO4EfYvhf8vjk"}

Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the DM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver's tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.</p><p><strong>Artisan's Tools.</strong> These special tools include the items needed to pursue a craft or trade. The table shows examples of the most common types of tools, each providing items related to a single craft. Proficiency with a set of artisan's tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make using the tools in your craft. Each type of artisan's tools requires a separate proficiency.</p><p><strong>Disguise Kit.</strong> This pouch of cosmetics, hair dye, and small props lets you create disguises that change your physical appearance. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to create a visual disguise.</p><p><strong>Forgery Kit.</strong> This small box contains a variety of papers and parchments, pens and inks, seals and sealing wax, gold and silver leaf, and other supplies necessary to create convincing forgeries of physical documents. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to create a physical forgery of a document.</p><p><strong>Gaming Set.</strong> This item encompasses a wide range of game pieces, including dice and decks of cards (for games such as Three-Dragon Ante). A few common examples appear on the Tools table, but other kinds of gaming sets exist. If you are proficient with a gaming set, you can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you make to play a game with that set. Each type of gaming set requires a separate proficiency.</p><p><strong>Herbalism Kit.</strong> This kit contains a variety of instruments such as clippers, mortar and pestle, and pouches and vials used by herbalists to create remedies and potions. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to identify or apply herbs. Also, proficiency with this kit is required to create <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/antitoxin\">antitoxin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/potion-of-healing\">potion of healing</a>.</p><p><strong>Musical Instrument.</strong> Several of the most common types of musical instruments are shown on the table as examples. If you have proficiency with a given musical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to play music with the instrument. A bard can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus, as described in <a title=\"Components\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting#Components\">chapter 10</a>. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.</p><p><strong>Navigator's Tools.</strong> This set of instruments is used for navigation at sea. Proficiency with navigator's tools lets you chart a ship's course and follow navigation charts. In addition, these tools allow you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make to avoid getting lost at sea.</p><p><strong>Poisoner's Kit.</strong> A poisoner's kit includes the vials, chemicals, and other equipment necessary for the creation of poisons. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to craft or use poisons.</p><p><strong>Thieves' Tools.</strong> This set of tools includes a small file, a set of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers.

Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher- level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class's description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.</p><p>When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively \"filling\" a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size — small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when Umara casts <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"magic missile\">magic missile</a>, a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.</p><p>Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots (see <a title=\"Resting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring#Resting\">chapter 8</a> for the rules on resting).</p><p>Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.</p><h3>Casting a Spell at a Higher Level</h3><p>When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"magic missile\">magic missile</a>&nbsp;using one of her 2nd-level slots, that <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"magic missile\">magic missile</a> is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.</p><p>Some spells, such as <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"magic missile\">magic missile</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"cure wounds\">cure wounds</a>, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell's description.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>CASTING IN ARMOR</strong></p>\n<p>Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.</p>\n</blockquote><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster's mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip's spell level is 0.</p></div>","img":null}

{"_id":"Kca9E3y8VCYxkNwJ","name":"10 Chapter 8: Adventuring","permission":{"default":0,"DJNYgTCLxATVgLjS":3},"folder":"","flags":{"vtta":{"name":"10 Chapter 8: Adventuring","sceneId":null}},"content":"<h1>Chapter 8: Adventuring</h1><p>Delving into the ancient Tomb of Horrors, slipping through the back alleys of Waterdeep, hacking a fresh trail through the thick jungles on the Isle of Dread—these are the things that Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventures are made of. Your character in the game might explore forgotten ruins and uncharted lands, uncover dark secrets and sinister plots, and slay foul monsters. And if all goes well, your character will survive to claim rich rewards before embarking on a new adventure.</p><p>This chapter covers the basics of the adventuring life, from the mechanics of movement to the complexities of social interaction. The rules for resting are also in this chapter, along with a discussion of the activities your character might pursue between adventures.</p><p>Whether adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon or the complex relationships of a royal court, the game follows a natural rhythm, as outlined in the book’s introduction:</p><ol>\n<li><strong>The DM describes the environment.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The players describe what they want to do.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The DM narrates the results of their actions.</strong></li>\n</ol><p>Typically, the DM uses a map as an outline of the adventure, tracking the characters’ progress as they explore dungeon corridors or wilderness regions. The DM’s notes, including a key to the map, describe what the adventurers find as they enter each new area. Sometimes, the passage of time and the adventurers’ actions determine what happens, so the DM might use a timeline or a flowchart to track their progress instead of a map.</p><h2>Time</h2><p>In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the DM determines the time a task requires. The DM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers' movement happens on a scale of <strong>minutes</strong>. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.</p><p>In a city or wilderness, a scale of <strong>hours</strong> is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours' time.</p><p>For long journeys, a scale of <strong>days</strong> works best. Following the road from Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.</p><p>In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on <strong>rounds</strong>, a 6-second span of time described in chapter 9, “<a title=\"The Order of Combat\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat#TheOrderofCombat\">Combat</a>.”.</p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/3/293/we_gnomegoggles.png\"></p><h2>Movement</h2><p>Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope — all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.</p><p>The DM can summarize the adventurers' movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: \"You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.\" Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the DM can summarize movement between encounters: \"After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.\"</p><p>Sometimes it's important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they're moving over.</p><h3>Speed</h3><p>Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.</p><p>The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p><h4>Travel Pace</h4><p>While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully (see the “<a title=\"Activity While Traveling\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring#ActivityWhileTraveling\">Activity While Traveling</a>” section later in this chapter for more information).</p><p><strong>Forced March.</strong> The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a>.</p><p>For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a>.</p><p><strong>Mounts and Vehicles.</strong> For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.</p><p>Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel (see chapter 5, “<a title=\"Mounts and Vehicles\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#MountsandVehicles\">Equipment</a>”), and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.</p><p>Certain special mounts, such as a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/pegasus\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"pegasus\">pegasus</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/griffon\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"griffon\">griffon</a>, or special vehicles, such as a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/broom-of-flying\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"broom of flying\">broom of flying</a>, allow you to travel more swiftly.&nbsp;The <em><span class=\"italic\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</span></em> contains more information on special methods of travel.</p><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Pace</th>\n<th>Distance per Minute</th>\n<th>Distance per Hour</th>\n<th>Distance per Day</th>\n<th class=\"movementeffect\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Effect</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Fast</td>\n<td>400 feet</td>\n<td>4 miles</td>\n<td>30 miles</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">-5 penalty to passive Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) scores</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Normal</td>\n<td>300 feet</td>\n<td>3 miles</td>\n<td>24 miles</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slow</td>\n<td>200 feet</td>\n<td>2 miles</td>\n<td>18 miles</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Able to use stealth</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h4>Difficult Terrain</h4><p>The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground — all considered difficult terrain.</p><p>You move at half speed in difficult terrain — moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed — so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p><h3>Special Types of Movement</h3><p>Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.</p><h4>Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling</h4><p>Each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain) when you’re climbing, swimming, or crawling. You ignore this extra cost if you have a climbing speed and use it to climb, or a swimming speed and use it to swim. At the DM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) check.</p><h4>Jumping</h4><p>Your Strength determines how far you can jump.</p><p><strong>Long Jump.</strong> When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.</p><p>This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your DM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.</p><p>When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a>.</p><p><strong>High Jump.</strong> When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.&nbsp;In some circumstances, your DM might allow you to make a Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) check to jump higher than you normally can.</p><p>You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1 1/2 times your height.</p><h3>Activity While Traveling</h3><p>As adventurers travel through a dungeon or the wilderness, they need to remain alert for danger, and some characters might perform other tasks to help the group’s journey.</p><h4>Marching Order</h4><p>The adventurers should establish a marching order. A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies when a fight breaks out.</p><p>A character might occupy the front rank, one or more middle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front and back ranks need enough room to travel side by side with others in their rank. When space is too tight, the marching order must change, usually by moving characters to a middle rank.</p><p><strong>Fewer Than Three Ranks.</strong> If an adventuring party arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they are a front rank and a back rank. If there’s only one rank, it’s considered a front rank.</p><h4>Stealth</h4><p>While traveling at a slow pace, the characters can move stealthily. As long as they’re not in the open, they can try to surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter. See the rules for hiding in chapter 7 \"<a title=\"Using Ability Scores\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/using-ability-scores#Dexterity\">Using Ability Scores</a>.\"</p><blockquote>\n<p id=\"splitting-up-the-party\"><strong>SPLITTING UP THE PARTY</strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes, it makes sense to split an adventuring party, especially if you want one or more characters to scout ahead. You can form multiple parties, each moving at a different speed. Each group has its own front, middle, and back ranks.</p>\n<p>The drawback to this approach is that the party will be split into several smaller groups in the event of an attack. The advantage is that a small group of stealthy characters moving slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that clumsier characters would alert. A pair of rogues moving at a slow pace are much harder to detect when they leave their dwarf fighter friend behind.</p>\n</blockquote><h4>Noticing Threats</h4><p>Use the passive Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) scores of the characters to determine whether anyone in the group notices a hidden threat. The DM might decide that a threat can be noticed only by characters in a particular rank. For example, as the characters are exploring a maze of tunnels, the DM might decide that only those characters in the back rank have a chance to hear or spot a stealthy creature following the group, while characters in the front and middle ranks cannot.</p><p>While traveling at a fast pace, characters take a –5 penalty to their passive Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) scores to notice hidden threats.</p><p><strong>Encountering Creatures.</strong> If the DM determines that the adventurers encounter other creatures while they’re traveling, it’s up to both groups to decide what happens next. Either group might decide to attack, initiate a conversation, run away, or wait to see what the other group does.</p><p><strong>Surprising Foes.</strong> If the adventurers encounter a hostile creature or group, the DM determines whether the adventurers or their foes might be surprised when combat erupts. See <a title=\"Surprise\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat#Surprise\">chapter 9</a>&nbsp;for more about surprise.</p><h4>Other Activities</h4><p>Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels are not focused on watching for danger. These characters don’t contribute their passive Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) scores to the group’s chance of noticing hidden threats. However, a character not watching for danger can do one of the following activities instead, or some other activity with the DM’s permission.</p><p><strong>Navigate.</strong> The character can try to prevent the group from becoming lost, making a Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival\">Survival</a>) check when the DM calls for it. (The <i>Dungeon Master’s Guide</i> has rules to determine whether the group gets lost.)</p><p><strong>Draw a Map.</strong> The character can draw a map that records the group’s progress and helps the characters get back on course if they get lost. No ability check is required.</p><p><strong>Track.</strong> A character can follow the tracks of another creature, making a Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival\">Survival</a>) check when the DM calls for it. (The <i>Dungeon Master’s Guide</i> has rules for tracking.)</p><p><strong>Forage.</strong> The character can keep an eye out for ready sources of food and water, making a Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival\">Survival</a>) check when the DM calls for it. (The <i>Dungeon Master’s Guide</i> has rules for foraging.)</p><h2>The Environment</h2><p>By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.&nbsp;The <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>&nbsp;has rules covering more unusual situations.</p><h3>Falling</h3><p>A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer.</p><p>At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a>, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.</p><h3>Suffocating</h3><p>A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).</p><p>When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.</p><p>For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.</p><h3>Vision and Light</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/670/c81.jpg\"></p><p>The most fundamental tasks of adventuring — noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few — rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.</p><p>A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a <strong>lightly obscured</strong> area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) checks that rely on sight.</p><p>A <strong><span class=\"bold\">heavily obscured</span></strong> area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded\">blinded</a> condition when trying to see something in that area.</p><p>The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.</p><p><strong>Bright light</strong> lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.</p><p><strong>Dim light</strong>, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.</p><p><strong>Darkness</strong> creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.</p><h4>Blindsight</h4><p>A creature with <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Blindsight\">blindsight</a> can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.</p><h4>Darkvision</h4><p>Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision\">darkvision</a>. Within a specified range, a creature with <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision\">darkvision</a> can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in that darkness, only shades of gray.</p><h4>Truesight</h4><p>A creature with <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Truesight\">truesight</a> can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible\">invisible</a> creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.</p><h3>Food and Water</h3><p>Characters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a>. <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">Exhaustion</a> caused by lack of food or water can't be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.</p><h4>Food</h4><p>A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.</p><p>A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a>.</p><p>A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.</p><h4>Water</h4><p>A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a> at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a> at the end of the day.</p><p>If the character already has one or more levels of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a>, the character takes two levels in either case.</p><h3>Interacting with Objects</h3><p>A character's interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the DM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if anything, happens.</p><p>For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the DM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The DM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.</p><p>Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The DM determines an object's Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It's hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.</p><p>A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The DM sets the DC for any such check.</p><h2>Social Interaction</h2><p>Exploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying monsters are key parts of D&amp;D adventures. No less important, though, are the social interactions that adventurers have with other inhabitants of the world.</p><p>Interaction takes on many forms. You might need to convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to some malfeasance, or you might try to flatter a dragon so that it will spare your life. The DM assumes the roles of any characters who are participating in the interaction that don’t belong to another player at the table. Any such character is called a <b>nonplayer character</b> (NPC).</p><p>In general terms, an NPC’s attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are inclined to get in your way. It’s easier to get what you want from a friendly NPC, of course.</p><p>Social interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks.</p><h3>Roleplaying</h3><p>Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it’s you as a player determining how your character thinks, acts, and talks.</p><p>Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions. Your character’s quirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how interactions resolve.</p><p>There are two styles you can use when roleplaying your character: the descriptive approach and the active approach. Most players use a combination of the two styles. Use whichever mix of the two works best for you.</p><h4>Descriptive Approach to Roleplaying</h4><p>With this approach, you describe your character’s words and actions to the DM and the other players. Drawing on your mental image of your character, you tell everyone what your character does and how he or she does it.</p><p>For instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek has a quick temper and blames the elves of the Cloakwood for his family’s misfortune. At a tavern, an obnoxious elf minstrel sits at Tordek’s table and tries to strike up a conversation with the dwarf.</p><p>Chris says, “Tordek spits on the floor, growls an insult at the bard, and stomps over to the bar. He sits on a stool and glares at the minstrel before ordering another drink.”</p><p>In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek’s mood and given the DM a clear idea of his character’s attitude and actions.</p><p>When using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following things in mind:</p><ul>\n<li>Describe your character’s emotions and attitude.</li>\n<li>Focus on your character’s intent and how others might perceive it.</li>\n<li>Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with.</li>\n</ul><p>Don’t worry about getting things exactly right. Just focus on thinking about what your character would do and describing what you see in your mind.</p><h4>Active Approach to Roleplaying</h4><p>If descriptive roleplaying tells your DM and your fellow players what your character thinks and does, active roleplaying <em>shows</em> them.</p><p>When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your character’s voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might even echo your character’s movements and body language. This approach is more immersive than descriptive roleplaying, though you still need to describe things that can’t be reasonably acted out.</p><p>Going back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek above, here’s how the scene might play out if Chris used active roleplaying:</p><p>Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice, “I was wondering why it suddenly smelled awful in here. If I wanted to hear anything out of you, I’d snap your arm and enjoy your screams.” In his normal voice, Chris then adds, “I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar.”</p><h4>Results of Roleplaying</h4><p>The DM uses your character’s actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles under threats of violence. A stubborn dwarf refuses to let anyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.</p><p>When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the DM’s portrayal of the NPC’s mood, dialogue, and personality. You might be able to determine an NPC’s personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on them to influence the NPC’s attitude.</p><p>Interactions in D&amp;D are much like interactions in real life. If you can offer NPCs something they want, threaten them with something they fear, or play on their sympathies and goals, you can use words to get almost anything you want. On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a noble’s allies, your efforts to convince or deceive will fall short.</p><h3>Ability Checks</h3><p>In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in determining the outcome of an interaction.</p><p>Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC’s attitude, but there might still be an element of chance in the situation. For example, your DM can call for a Charisma check at any point during an interaction if he or she wants the dice to play a role in determining an NPC’s reactions. Other checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your DM’s discretion.</p><p>Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the deck in your favor by using an approach that relies on your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick a guard into letting them into a castle, the rogue who is proficient in <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Deception\">Deception</a> is the best bet to lead the discussion. When negotiating for a hostage’s release, the cleric with <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Persuasion\">Persuasion</a> should do most of the talking.</p><h2>Resting</h2><p>Heroic though they might be, adventurers can't spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest — time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.</p><p>Adventurers, as well as other creatures, can take short rests in the midst of a day and a long rest to end it.</p><h3>Short Rest</h3><p>A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.</p><p>A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total (minimum of 0). The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.</p><h3>Long Rest</h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch.</span> If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity — at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity — the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.</p><p>At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.</p><p>A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.</p><h2>Between Adventures</h2><p>Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.</p><p>In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the DM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the DM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.</p><h3>Lifestyle Expenses</h3><p>Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as described in <a title=\"Lifestyle Expenses\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#LifestyleExpenses\">chapter 5</a>.</p><p>Living a particular lifestyle doesn't have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.</p><h3>Downtime Activities</h3><p>Between adventures, the DM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.</p><p>Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your DM.</p><h4>Crafting</h4><p>You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan's tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith's tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.</p><p>For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.</p><p>Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.</p><p>While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see <a title=\"Lifestyle Expenses\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#LifestyleExpenses\">chapter 5</a> for more information on lifestyle expenses).</p><h4>Practicing a Profession</h4><p>You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day (see <a title=\"Lifestyle Expenses\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#LifestyleExpenses\">chapter 5</a> for more information on lifestyle expenses). This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.</p><p>If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves' guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.</p><p>If you have proficiency in the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Performance\">Performance</a> skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.</p><h4>Recuperating</h4><p>You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.</p><p>After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:</p><ul>\n<li>End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.</li>\n<li>For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.</li>\n</ul><h4>Researching</h4><p>The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.</p><p>When you begin your research, the DM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The DM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\">Investigation</a>) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Persuasion\">Persuasion</a>) check to secure someone's aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.</p><p>For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses (as discussed in <a title=\"Lifestyle Expenses\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#LifestyleExpenses\">chapter 5</a>).</p><h4>Training</h4><p>You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your DM might allow additional training options.</p><p>First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The DM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.</p><p>The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.</p>","img":null}

{"name":"06 Chapter 5.11: Expenses","permission":{"default":0,"DJNYgTCLxATVgLjS":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":2200000}},"content":"<h2>Expenses</h2><div><p>When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.</p><h3>Lifestyle Expenses</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/732/c512.png\"></p><p>Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.</p><p>At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character's career.</p><p>Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.</p><div><table class=\"compendium-gear-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Lifestyle</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">Price/Day</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wretched</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Squalid</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">1 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Poor</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">2 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Modest</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">1 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Comfortable</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">2 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wealthy</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">4 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Aristocratic</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">10 gp minimum</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p><strong>Wretched.</strong> You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.</p><p><strong>Squalid.</strong> You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.</p><p><strong>Poor.</strong> A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.</p><p><strong>Modest.</strong> A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.</p><p><strong>Comfortable.</strong> Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.</p><p><strong>Wealthy.</strong> Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.</p><p><strong>Aristocratic.</strong> You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>SELF SUFFICIENCY</strong></p>\n<p>The expenses and lifestyles described in this chapter assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford — paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.</p>\n<p>Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession as described in <a title=\"Practicing a Profession\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring#PracticingaProfession\">chapter 8</a>, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival\">Survival</a> skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.</p>\n</blockquote><h3>Food, Drink, and Lodging</h3><p>The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food items and a single night's lodging. These prices are included in your total lifestyle expenses.</p><p><strong>Food and Drink</strong></p><div><table id=\"expensesfooddrink\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Item</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">Cost</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Ale (gallon)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">2 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Ale (mug)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">4 cp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Banquet (per person)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">10 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Bread, loaf</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">2 cp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Cheese, hunk</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">1 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Meat, chunk</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">3 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wine, common (pitcher)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">2 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wine, fine (bottle)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">10 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p><strong>Meals and Lodging (per day)</strong></p><div><table class=\"compendium-gear-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Item</th>\n<th class=\"gear-cost\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">Meals Cost</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">Lodging Cost</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Squalid</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">3 cp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">7 cp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Poor</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">6 cp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">1 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Modest</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">3 sp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">5 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Comfortable</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">5 sp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">8 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wealthy</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">8 sp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">2 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Aristocratic</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">2 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">4 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h3>Services</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/733/c513.png\"></p><p>Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.</p><p>Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming in front of the duke.</p><p>Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.</p><div><table class=\"expenses-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Service</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Pay</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Coach cab (Between towns)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">3 cp per mile</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Coach cab (Within a city)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 cp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Hireling (Skilled)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2 gp per day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Hireling (Untrained)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2 sp per day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Messenger</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2 cp per mile</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Road or gate toll</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 cp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Ship's passage</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 sp per mile</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p>Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.</p><h3>Spellcasting Services</h3><p>People who are able to cast spells don't fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.</p><p>Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"cure wounds\">cure wounds</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"identify\">identify</a>, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment — the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.</p></div>","img":null,"_id":"NExAt0t96fdIwApd"}

{"_id":"SBXrbt9BJnLw9TNs","name":"12 Chapter 10.6: Casting a Spell","permission":{"default":0,"DJNYgTCLxATVgLjS":3},"folder":"","flags":{"entityorder":{"order":1000000}},"content":"<h2>Casting a Spell</h2><div><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/675/c101.png\"></p><p>When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character's class or the spell's effects.</p><p>Each spell description in <a title=\"Spell Descriptions\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spells#SpellDescriptions\">Chapter 11</a>&nbsp;begins with a block of information, including the spell's name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect.</p><h3>Casting Time</h3><p>Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.</p><h4>Bonus Action</h4><p>A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. You can't cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.</p><h4>Reactions</h4><p>Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.</p><h4>Longer Casting Times</h4><p>Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so. If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.</p><h3>Range</h3><p>The target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell like <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"magic missile\">magic missile</a>, the target is a creature. For a spell like <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"fireball\">fireball</a>, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.</p><p>Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/shield\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"shield\">shield</a> spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.</p><p>Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell's effect must be you (see “<a title=\"Areas of Effect\" href=\"#AreasofEffect\">Areas of Effect</a>” later in the this chapter).</p><p>Once a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the spell's description says otherwise.</p><h3>Components</h3><p>A spell's components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell's description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can't provide one or more of a spell's components, you are unable to cast the spell.</p><h4>Verbal (V)</h4><p>Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/silence\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"silence\">silence</a> spell, can't cast a spell with a verbal component.</p><h4>Somatic (S)</h4><p>Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.</p><h4>Material (M)</h4><p>Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a <strong>component pouch</strong> or a <strong>spellcasting focus</strong> (found in chapter 5, “<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>”) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.</p><p>If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.</p><p>A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell's material components — or to hold a spellcasting focus — but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.</p><h3>Duration</h3><p>A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.</p><h4>Instantaneous</h4><p>Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.</p><h4>Concentration</h4><p>Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.</p><p>If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).</p><p>Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Casting another spell that requires concentration.</strong> You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can't concentrate on two spells at once.</li>\n<li><strong>Taking damage.</strong> Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Being incapacitated or killed.</strong> You lose concentration on a spell if you are <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a> or if you die.</li>\n</ul><p>The DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.</p><h3>Targets</h3><p>A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).</p><p>Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature's thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.</p><h4>A Clear Path to the Target</h4><p>To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover.</p><p>If you place an area of effect at a point that you can't see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.</p><h4>Targeting Yourself</h4><p>If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.</p><aside>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"the-weave-of-magic\"><strong>THE WEAVE OF MAGIC</strong></p>\n<p>The worlds within the D&amp;D multiverse are magical places. All existence is suffused with magical power, and potential energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and living creature, and even in the air itself. Raw magic is the stuff of creation, the mute and mindless will of existence, permeating every bit of matter and present in every manifestation of energy throughout the multiverse.</p>\n<p>Mortals can’t directly shape this raw magic. Instead, they make use of a fabric of magic, a kind of interface between the will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic. The spellcasters of the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and recognize its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters have varied ways of naming and visualizing this interface. By any name, without the Weave, raw magic is locked away and inaccessible; the most powerful archmage can’t light a candle with magic in an area where the Weave has been torn. But surrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning to blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the blink of an eye, or even reverse death itself.</p>\n<p>All magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds of magic access it in a variety of ways. The spells of wizards, warlocks, sorcerers, and bards are commonly called <b>arcane magic</b>. These spells rely on an understanding—learned or intuitive—of the workings of the Weave. The caster plucks directly at the strands of the Weave to create the desired effect. Eldritch knights and arcane tricksters also use arcane magic. The spells of clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers are called <b>divine magic</b>. These spellcasters’ access to the Weave is mediated by divine power—gods, the divine forces of nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin’s oath.</p>\n<p>Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads of the Weave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect possible. When characters use divination spells such as <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"detect magic\">detect magic</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"identify\">identify</a>, they glimpse the Weave. A spell such as <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dispel magic\">dispel magic</a> smooths the Weave. Spells such as <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antimagic-field\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"antimagic field\">antimagic field</a> rearrange the Weave so that magic flows around, rather than through, the area affected by the spell. And in places where the Weave is damaged or torn, magic works in unpredictable ways—or not at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside><h3>Areas of Effect</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/678/c102.png\"></p><p>Spells such as <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/burning-hands\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"burning hands\">burning hands</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cone-of-cold\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"cone of cold\">cone of cold</a> cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.</p><p>A spell's description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a <strong>point of origin</strong>, a location from which the spell's energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.</p><p>A spell's effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn't included in the spell's area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover, as explained in <a title=\"Cover\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat#Cover\">chapter 9</a>.</p><h4>Cone</h4><p>A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length.</p><p>A cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</p><h4>Cube</h4><p>You select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as the length of each side.</p><p>A cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</p><h4>Cylinder</h4><p>A cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell's effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.</p><p>A cylinder's point of origin is included in the cylinder's area of effect.</p><h4>Line</h4><p>A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.</p><p>A line's point of origin is not included in the line's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</p><h4>Sphere</h4><p>You select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.</p><p>A sphere's point of origin is included in the sphere's area of effect.</p><h3>Saving Throws</h3><p>Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.</p><p>The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.</p><h3>Attack Rolls</h3><p>Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p><p>Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn't <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a> (see <a title=\"Ranged Attacks in Close Combat\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat#RangedAttacksinCloseCombat\">chapter 9</a>).</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>THE SCHOOLS OF MAGIC</strong></p>\n<p>Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.</p>\n<p>The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.</p>\n<p><strong>Abjuration</strong> spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.</p>\n<p><strong>Conjuration</strong> spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster's side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.</p>\n<p><strong>Divination</strong> spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.</p>\n<p><strong>Enchantment</strong> spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.</p>\n<p><strong>Evocation</strong> spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Illusion</strong> spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Necromancy</strong> spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.</p>\n<p>Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/animate-dead\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"animate dead\">animate dead</a> is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.</p>\n<p><strong>Transmutation</strong> spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster's command, or enhance a creature's innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.</p>\n</blockquote><h3>Combining Magical Effects</h3><p>The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect — such as the highest bonus — from those castings applies while their durations overlap, or the most recent effect applies if the castings are equally potent and their durations overlap.</p><p>For example, if two clerics cast <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/bless\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"bless\">bless</a> on the same target, that character gains the spell's benefit only once; he or she doesn't get to roll two bonus dice.</p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/677/c103.png\"></p></div>","img":null}
{"_id":"SfqavU33QRWVQNDI","name":"11 Chapter 9: Combat","permission":{"default":0,"DJNYgTCLxATVgLjS":3},"folder":"","flags":{"vtta":{"name":"11 Chapter 9: Combat","sceneId":null}},"content":"<h1>Chapter 9: Combat</h1><p>The clatter of a sword striking against a shield. The terrible rending sound as monstrous claws tear through armor. A brilliant flash of light as a ball of flame blossoms from a wizard’s spell. The sharp tang of blood in the air, cutting through the stench of vile monsters. Roars of fury, shouts of triumph, cries of pain. Combat in D&amp;D can be chaotic, deadly, and thrilling.</p><p>This chapter provides the rules you need for your characters and monsters to engage in combat, whether it is a brief skirmish or an extended conflict in a dungeon or on a field of battle. Throughout this chapter, the rules address you, the player or Dungeon Master. The Dungeon Master controls all the monsters and nonplayer characters involved in combat, and each other player controls an adventurer. “You” can also mean the character or monster that you control.</p><h2>The Order of Combat</h2><p>A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A <strong>round</strong> represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a <strong>turn</strong>. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>COMBAT STEP-BY-STEP</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Determine surprise.</strong> The DM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised. <br> <strong>2. Establish positions.</strong> The DM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers' marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the DM figures out where the adversaries are — how far away and in what direction. <br> <strong>3. Roll initiative.</strong> Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns. <br> <strong>4. Take turns.</strong> Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order. <br> <strong>5. Begin the next round.</strong> When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.</p>\n</blockquote><h3>Surprise</h3><p>A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gelatinous-cube\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"gelatinous cube\">gelatinous cube</a> glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.</p><p>The DM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the DM compares the Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth\">Stealth</a>) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.</p><p>If you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.</p><h3>Initiative</h3><p>Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The DM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.</p><p>The DM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.</p><p>If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The DM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the DM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.</p><h3>Your Turn</h3><p>On your turn, you can <strong>move</strong> a distance up to your speed and <strong>take one action</strong>. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed — sometimes called your walking speed — is noted on your character sheet.</p><p>The most common actions you can take are described in the \"<a title=\"Actions in Combat\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat#ActionsinCombat\">Actions in Combat</a>\" section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.</p><p>The \"<a title=\"Movement and Position\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat#MovementandPosition\">Movement and Position</a>\"&nbsp;section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.</p><p>You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dodge\">Dodge</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Ready\">Ready</a> action, as described in \"<a title=\"Actions in Combat\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat#ActionsinCombat\">Actions in Combat</a>.\"</p><h4>Bonus Actions</h4><p>Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don't have a bonus action to take.</p><p>You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.</p><p>You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.</p><h4>Other Activity on Your Turn</h4><p>Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.</p><p>You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.</p><p>You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.</p><p>If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.</p><p>The DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.</p><h4>Reactions</h4><p>Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.</p><p>When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.</p><h2>Movement and Position</h2><p>In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.</p><p>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.</p><p>Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.</p><p>The “Special Types of Movement” section in <a title=\"Special Types of Movement\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring#SpecialTypesofMovement\">chapter 8</a> gives the particulars for jumping, climbing, and swimming.</p><h3>Breaking Up Your Move</h3><p>You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.</p><h4>Moving Between Attacks</h4><p>If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.</p><h4>Using Different Speeds</h4><p>If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.</p><p>For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fly\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"fly\">fly</a> spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.</p><h3>Difficult Terrain</h3><p>Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases — the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.</p><p>Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.</p><p>Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.</p><h3>Being Prone</h3><p>Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a>.</p><p>You can <strong>drop</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a> without using any of your speed. <strong>Standing up</strong> takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.</p><p>To move while <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a>, you must <strong>crawl</strong> or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>INTERACTING WITH OBJECTS AROUND YOU</strong></p>\n<p>Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>draw or sheathe a sword</li>\n<li>open or close a door</li>\n<li>withdraw a potion from your backpack</li>\n<li>pick up a dropped axe</li>\n<li>take a bauble from a table</li>\n<li>remove a ring from your finger</li>\n<li>stuff some food into your mouth</li>\n<li>plant a banner in the ground</li>\n<li>fish a few coins from your belt pouch</li>\n<li>drink all the ale in a flagon</li>\n<li>throw a lever or a switch</li>\n<li>pull a torch from a sconce</li>\n<li>take a book from a shelf you can reach</li>\n<li>extinguish a small flame</li>\n<li>don a mask</li>\n<li>pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head</li>\n<li>put your ear to a door</li>\n<li>kick a small stone</li>\n<li>turn a key in a lock</li>\n<li>tap the floor with a 10-foot pole</li>\n<li>hand an item to another character</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote><h3>Moving Around Other Creatures</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/671/c91.png\"></p><p>You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.</p><p>Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.</p><p>If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.</p><h3>Flying Movement</h3><p>Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a>, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fly\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"fly\">fly</a> spell.</p><h3>Creature Size</h3><p>Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.</p><p><strong>Size Categories</strong></p><div><table class=\"table-size-half\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"movementpositionsize\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Size</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Space</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Tiny</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2 1/2 by 2 1/2 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Small</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">5 by 5 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Medium</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">5 by 5 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Large</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">10 by 10 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Huge</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">15 by 15 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Gargantuan</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">20 by 20 ft. or larger</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h4>Space</h4><p>A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hobgoblin\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"hobgoblin\">hobgoblin</a> stands in a 5‐foot-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hobgoblin\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"hobgoblin\">hobgoblin</a> lets them.</p><p>A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.</p><p>Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If four Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.</p><h4>Squeezing into a Smaller Space</h4><p>A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>VARIANT: PLAYING ON A GRID</strong></p>\n<p>If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Squares.</strong> Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed.</strong> Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5-foot segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your speed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example, a speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.</p>\n<p>If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in squares on your character sheet.</p>\n<p><strong>Entering a Square.</strong> To enter a square, you must have at least 1 square of movement left, even if the square is diagonally adjacent to the square you’re in. (The rule for diagonal movement sacrifices realism for the sake of smooth play. The <i>Dungeon Master’s Guide</i> provides guidance on using a more realistic approach.)</p>\n<p>If a square costs extra movement, as a square of difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of difficult terrain.</p>\n<p><strong>Corners.</strong> Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.</p>\n<p><strong>Ranges.</strong> To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or objects—start counting squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.</p>\n</blockquote><h2>Actions in Combat</h2><p>When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.</p><p>When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.</p><h3>Attack</h3><p>The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.</p><p>With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the \"Making an Attack\" section for the rules that govern attacks.</p><p>Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.</p><h3>Cast a Spell</h3><p>Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. See <a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting\">chapter 10</a> for the rules on spellcasting.</p><h3>Dash</h3><p>When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.</p><p>Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.</p><h3>Disengage</h3><p>If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.</p><h3>Dodge</h3><p>When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a> or if your speed drops to 0.</p><h3>Help</h3><p>You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.</p><p>Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.</p><h3>Hide</h3><p>When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth\">Stealth</a>) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the \"<a href=\"#UnseenAttackersandTargets\">Unseen Attackers and Targets</a>\" section later in this chapter.</p><h3>Ready</h3><p>Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.</p><p>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include \"If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it,\" and \"If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.\"</p><p>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.</p><p>When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires concentration (explained in <a title=\"Concentration\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting#Concentration\">chapter 10</a>). If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/web\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"web\">web</a> spell and ready <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"magic missile\">magic missile</a>, your <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/web\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"web\">web</a> spell ends, and if you take damage before you release <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"magic missile\">magic missile</a> with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.</p><h3>Search</h3><p>When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the DM might have you make a Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) check or an Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\">Investigation</a>) check.</p><h3>Use an Object</h3><p>You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.</p><blockquote>\n<p id=\"improvising-an-action\"><strong>IMPROVISING AN ACTION</strong></p>\n<p>Your character can do things not covered by the actions in this chapter, such as breaking down doors, intimidating enemies, sensing weaknesses in magical defenses, or calling for a parley with a foe. The only limits to the actions you can attempt are your imagination and your character’s ability scores. See the descriptions of the ability scores in <a title=\"Using Ability Scores\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/using-ability-scores\">chapter 7</a>&nbsp;for inspiration as you improvise.</p>\n<p>When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.</p>\n</blockquote><h2>Making an Attack</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/672/c92.png\"></p><p>Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.</p><p><strong>1. Choose a target.</strong> Pick a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a location.</p><p><strong>2. Determine modifiers.</strong> The DM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.</p><p><strong>3. Resolve the attack.</strong> You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.</p><p>If there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're making an attack roll, you're making an attack.</p><h3>Attack Rolls</h3><p>When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.</p><h4>Modifiers to the Roll</h4><p>When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.</p><p><strong>Ability Modifier.</strong> The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties\">finesse</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties\">thrown</a> property break this rule.</p><p>Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster, as explained in <a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting\">chapter 10</a>.</p><p><strong>Proficiency Bonus.</strong> You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.</p><h4>Rolling 1 or 20</h4><p>Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.</p><p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.</p><p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.</p><h3>Unseen Attackers and Targets</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/673/c93.png\"></p><p>Combatants often try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, casting the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/invisibility\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"invisibility\">invisibility</a> spell, or lurking in darkness.</p><p>When you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the DM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly.</p><p>When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it.</p><p>If you are hidden — both unseen and unheard — when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.</p><h3>Ranged Attacks</h3><p>When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.</p><h4>Range</h4><p>You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.</p><p>If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range.</p><p>Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack a target beyond the long range.</p><h4>Ranged Attacks in Close Combat</h4><p>Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn't <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a>.</p><h3>Melee Attacks</h3><p>Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.</p><p>Most creatures have a 5-foot <strong>reach</strong> and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.</p><p>Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an <strong>unarmed strike</strong>: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.</p><h4>Opportunity Attacks</h4><p>In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.</p><p>You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.</p><p>You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Disengage\">Disengage</a> action. You also don't provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don't provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.</p><h4>Two-Weapon Fighting</h4><p>When you take the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\">Attack</a> action and attack with a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties\">light</a> melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties\">light</a> melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.</p><p>If either weapon has the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties\">thrown</a> property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.</p><blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"ContestsinCombat\" style=\"font-size: 14px; text-transform: uppercase;\">Contests in Combat</h4>\n<p>Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The DM can use these contests as models for improvising others.</p>\n</blockquote><h4>Grappling</h4><p>When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\">Attack</a> action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\">Attack</a> action, this attack replaces one of them.</p><p>The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) check contested by the target's Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) or Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a>. If you succeed, you subject the target to the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Grappled\">grappled</a> condition. The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).</p><p><strong>Escaping a Grapple.</strong> A <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Grappled\">grappled</a> creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) or Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>) check contested by your Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) check.</p><p><strong>Moving a Grappled Creature.</strong> When you move, you can drag or carry the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Grappled\">grappled</a> creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.</p><h4>Shoving a Creature</h4><p>Using the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\">Attack</a> action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a> or push it away from you. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\">Attack</a> action, this attack replaces one of them.</p><p>The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) check contested by the target's Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) or Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a>. If you succeed, you either knock the target <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a> or push it 5 feet away from you.</p><h2>Cover</h2><p>Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.</p><p>There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.</p><h3>Half Cover</h3><p>A target with <strong>half cover</strong> has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.</p><h3>Three-Quarters Cover</h3><p>A target with <strong>three-quarters</strong> cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.</p><h3>Total Cover</h3><p>A target with <strong>total cover</strong> can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.</p><h2>Damage and Healing</h2><p>Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"fireball\">fireball</a> spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><p>Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.</p><p>A creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.</p><p>Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.</p><h3>Damage Rolls</h3><p>Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage.</p><p>With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.</p><p>When attacking with a <strong>weapon</strong>, you add your ability modifier — the same modifier used for the attack roll — to the damage. A <strong>spell</strong> tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.</p><p>If a spell or other effect deals damage to <strong>more than one target</strong> at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"fireball\">fireball</a> or a cleric casts <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/flame-strike\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"flame strike\">flame strike</a>, the spell's damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.</p><h4>Critical Hits</h4><p>When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.</p><p>For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue's Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.</p><h3>Damage Types</h3><p>Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.</p><p>The damage types follow, with examples to help a DM assign a damage type to a new effect.</p><p><strong>Acid. </strong>The corrosive spray of an <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/adult-black-dragon\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"adult black dragon\">adult black dragon</a>'s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/black-pudding\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"black pudding\">black pudding</a> deal acid damage.</p><p><strong>Bludgeoning. </strong>Blunt force attacks — hammers, falling, constriction, and the like — deal bludgeoning damage.</p><p><strong>Cold. </strong>The infernal chill radiating from an <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ice-devil\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"ice devil\">ice devil</a>'s spear and the frigid blast of a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/young-white-dragon\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"young white dragon\">young white dragon</a>'s breath deal cold damage.</p><p><strong>Fire. </strong><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ancient-red-dragon\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"Ancient red dragon\">Ancient red dragon</a>s breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.</p><p><strong>Force. </strong>Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"magic missile\">magic missile</a>&nbsp;and<strong> <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/spiritual-weapon\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"spiritual weapon\">spiritual weapon</a>.</strong></p><p><strong>Lightning. </strong>A <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lightning-bolt\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"lightning bolt\">lightning bolt</a> spell and a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/blue-dragon-wyrmling\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"blue dragon wyrmling\">blue dragon wyrmling</a>'s breath deal lightning damage.</p><p><strong>Necrotic. </strong>Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/chill-touch\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"chill touch\">chill touch</a>, withers matter and even the soul.</p><p><strong>Piercing. </strong>Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters' bites, deal piercing damage.</p><p><strong>Poison. </strong>Venomous stings and the toxic gas of an <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/adult-green-dragon\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"adult green dragon\">adult green dragon</a>'s breath deal poison damage.</p><p><strong>Psychic. </strong>Mental abilities such as a psionic blast deal psychic damage.</p><p><strong>Radiant. </strong>Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric's <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/flame-strike\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"flame strike\">flame strike</a> spell or an angel's smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.</p><p><strong>Slashing. </strong>Swords, axes, and monsters' claws deal slashing damage.</p><p><strong>Thunder. </strong>A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/thunderwave\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"thunderwave\">thunderwave</a>&nbsp;spell, deals thunder damage.</p><h3>Damage Resistance and Vulnerability</h3><p>Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.</p><p>If a creature or an object has <strong>resistance</strong> to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has <strong>vulnerability</strong> to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.</p><p>Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.</p><p>Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.</p><h3>Healing</h3><p>Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature's hit points (as explained in <a title=\"Resting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring#Resting\">chapter 8</a>), and magical methods such as a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"cure wounds\">cure wounds</a> spell or a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/potion-of-healing\">potion of healing</a> can remove damage in an instant.</p><p>When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.</p><p>A creature that has died can't regain hit points until magic such as the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/revivify\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"revivify\">revivify</a> spell has restored it to life.</p><h3>Dropping to 0 Hit Points</h3><p>When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\">unconscious</a>, as explained in the following sections.</p><h4>Instant Death</h4><p>Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.</p><p>For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.</p><h4>Falling Unconscious</h4><p>If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\">unconscious</a>. This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>DESCRIBING THE EFFECTS OF DAMAGE</strong></p>\n<p>Dungeon Masters describe hit point loss in different ways. When your current hit point total is half or more of your hit point maximum, you typically show no signs of injury. When you drop below half your hit point maximum, you show signs of wear, such as cuts and bruises. An attack that reduces you to 0 hit points strikes you directly, leaving a bleeding injury or other trauma, or it simply knocks you <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\">unconscious</a>.</p>\n</blockquote><h4>Death Saving Throws</h4><p>Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.</p><p>Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.</p><p><strong>Rolling 1 or 20.</strong> When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.</p><p><strong>Damage at 0 Hit Points.</strong> If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.</p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/674/c94.png\"></p><h4>Stabilizing a Creature</h4><p>The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving throw.</p><p>You can use your action to administer first aid to an <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\">unconscious</a> creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Medicine\">Medicine</a>) check.</p><p>A <strong>stable</strong> creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\">unconscious</a>. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.</p><h4>Monsters and Death</h4><p>Most DMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\">unconscious</a> and make death saving throws.</p><p>Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the DM might have them fall <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\">unconscious</a> and follow the same rules as player characters.</p><h3>Knocking a Creature Out</h3><p>Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\">unconscious</a> and is stable.</p><h3>Temporary Hit Points</h3><p>Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.</p><p>When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.</p><p>Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.</p><p>Healing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.</p><p>If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you.</p><p>Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Mounted Combat</h2><p>A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.</p><p>A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.</p><h3>Mounting and Dismounting</h3><p>Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.</p><p>If an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a> in a space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a> while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.</p><p>If your mount is knocked <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a>, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a> in a space within 5 feet it.</p><h3>Controlling a Mount</h3><p>While you’re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.</p><p>You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash\">Dash</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Disengage\">Disengage</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dodge\">Dodge</a>. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.</p><p>An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.</p><p>In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.</p><h2>Underwater Combat</h2><p>When adventurers pursue <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/sahuagin\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"sahuagin\">sahuagin</a> back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.</p><p>When making a <strong>melee weapon attack</strong>, a creature that doesn't have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.</p><p>A <strong>ranged weapon attack</strong> automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).</p><p>Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.</p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/3/292/c5-10.png\"></p>","img":null}
{"_id":"Si4PsU0GJdipK22a","name":"09 Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores","permission":{"default":0,"DJNYgTCLxATVgLjS":3},"folder":"","flags":{"vtta":{"name":"09 Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores","sceneId":null}},"content":"<h1>Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores</h1><p>Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Strength</strong>, measuring physical power</li>\n<li><strong>Dexterity</strong>, measuring agility</li>\n<li><strong>Constitution</strong>, measuring endurance</li>\n<li><strong>Intelligence</strong>, measuring reasoning and memory</li>\n<li><strong>Wisdom</strong>, measuring perception and insight</li>\n<li><strong>Charisma</strong>, measuring force of personality</li>\n</ul><p>Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities — a creature's assets as well as weaknesses.</p><p>The three main rolls of the game — the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll — rely on the six ability scores. The <a title=\"Introduction\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/introduction\">Introduction</a> describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.</p><p>This chapter focuses on how to use ability checks and saving throws, covering the fundamental activities that creatures attempt in the game. Rules for attack rolls appear in chapter 9, “<a title=\"Combat\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat\">Combat</a>.”</p><h2>Ability Scores and Modifiers</h2><p>Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability.</p><p>A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.</p><p>Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.</p><h4>Ability Scores and Modifiers Table</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"450116694\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[b5gvrVEnvE3tfg7P]{Modifier}</span></div></div></div><p>To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).&nbsp;</p><p>Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.</p><h2>Advantage and Disadvantage</h2><p>Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p><p>If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.</p><p>If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.</p><p>When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling's Lucky trait, lets you reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.</p><p>You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage (as explained in chapter 4, “<a title=\"Inspiration\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/personality-and-background#Inspiration\">Personality and Background</a>”). The DM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.</p><h2>Proficiency Bonus</h2><p>Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level, as detailed in <a title=\"Step-By-Step Characters\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/step-by-step-characters\">chapter 1</a>. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.</p><p>Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.</p><p>Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.</p><p>By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#History\">History</a> skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#History\">History</a>) checks.</p><p>In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.</p><h2>Ability Checks</h2><p>An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The DM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.</p><p>For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.</p><h4>Typical Difficulty Classes</h4><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"taskdifficulty\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Task Difficulty</th>\n<th class=\"taskdc\" style=\"text-align: left;\">DC</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Very easy</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Easy</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Medium</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Hard</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Very hard</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Nearly impossible</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">30</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p><br>To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success — the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the DM.</p><h3>Contests</h3><p>Sometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal — for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.</p><p>Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.</p><p>If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.</p><h3>Skills</h3><p>Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character's starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's skill proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.)</p><p>For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#SleightofHand\">Sleight of Hand</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth\">Stealth</a>, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth\">Stealth</a> skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.</p><p>The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.)

In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.</p><p>For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the DM might ask for a Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) check. If the character is proficient in <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.</p><h4>Variant: Skills with Different Abilities</h4><p>Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you're proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.</p><h3>Passive Checks</h3><p>A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the DM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.</p><p>Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:</p><p><strong>10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check</strong></p><p>If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a <strong>score</strong>.</p><p>For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>, he or she has a passive Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) score of 14.</p><p>The rules on hiding in the “<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/using-ability-scores#Dexterity\">Dexterity</a>” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules in chapter 8, “<a title=\"Adventuring\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring\">Adventuring</a>.”</p><h3>Working Together</h3><p>Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort — or the one with the highest ability modifier — can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Help\">Help</a> action (see chapter 9, “<a title=\"Help\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat#Help\">Combat</a>”).</p><p>A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves' tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.</p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/669/c71.png\"></p><h4>Group Checks</h4><p>When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the DM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.</p><p>To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.</p><p>Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the DM might call for a group Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival\">Survival</a>) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.</p><h2>Using Each Ability</h2><p>Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.</p><h3>Strength</h3><p>Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.</p><h4>Strength Checks</h4><p>A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a> skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.</p><h5>Athletics</h5><p>Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:</p><ul>\n<li>You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.</li>\n<li>You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.</li>\n<li>You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.</li>\n</ul><h5>Other Strength Checks</h5><p>The DM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul>\n<li>Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door</li>\n<li>Break free of bonds</li>\n<li>Push through a tunnel that is too small</li>\n<li>Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it</li>\n<li>Tip over a statue</li>\n<li>Keep a boulder from rolling</li>\n</ul><h4>Attack Rolls and Damage</h4><p>You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.</p><h4>Lifting and Carrying</h4><p>Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.</p><p><strong>Carrying Capacity.</strong> Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don't usually have to worry about it.</p><p><strong>Push, Drag, or Lift.</strong> You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.</p><p><strong>Size and Strength.</strong> Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.</p><h4>Variant: Encumbrance</h4><p>The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table in <a title=\"Armor and Shields\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#ArmorandShields\">chapter 5</a>.</p><p>If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are <strong>encumbered</strong>, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.</p><p>If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead <strong>heavily encumbered</strong>, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.</p><h3>Dexterity</h3><p>Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.</p><h4>Dexterity Checks</h4><p>A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#SleightofHand\">Sleight of Hand</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth\">Stealth</a> skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.</p><h5>Acrobatics</h5><p>Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.</p><h5>Sleight of Hand</h5><p>Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.</p><h5>Stealth</h5><p>Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.</p><h5>Other Dexterity Checks</h5><p>The DM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul>\n<li>Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent</li>\n<li>Steer a chariot around a tight turn</li>\n<li>Pick a lock</li>\n<li>Disable a trap</li>\n<li>Securely tie up a prisoner</li>\n<li>Wriggle free of bonds</li>\n<li>Play a stringed instrument</li>\n<li>Craft a small or detailed object</li>\n</ul><h4>Attack Rolls and Damage</h4><p>You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.</p><h4>Armor Class</h4><p>Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, as described in chapter 5, \"<a title=\"Armor and Shields\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#ArmorandShields\">Equipment</a>.\"</p><h4>Initiative</h4><p>At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures' turns in combat, as described in chapter 9, \"<a title=\"Initiative\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat#Initiative\">Combat</a>.\"</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>HIDING</strong></p>\n<p>The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth\">Stealth</a>) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.</p>\n<p>You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase. An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.</p>\n<p>In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.</p>\n<p><strong>Passive Perception.</strong> When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth\">Stealth</a>) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.</p>\n<p>For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>, he or she has a passive Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) of 14.</p>\n<p><strong>What Can You See?</strong> One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be <strong>lightly</strong> or <strong>heavily obscured&nbsp;</strong>as explained in chapter 8, “<a title=\"Vision and Light\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring#VisionandLight\">Adventuring</a>.”</p>\n</blockquote><h3>Constitution</h3><p>Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.</p><h4>Constitution Checks</h4><p>Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.</p><p>The DM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul>\n<li>Hold your breath</li>\n<li>March or labor for hours without rest</li>\n<li>Go without sleep</li>\n<li>Survive without food or water</li>\n<li>Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go</li>\n</ul><h4>Hit Points</h4><p>Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.</p><p>If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you're 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.</p><h3>Intelligence</h3><p>Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.</p><h4>Intelligence Checks</h4><p>An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Arcana\">Arcana</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#History\">History</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\">Investigation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Nature\">Nature</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Religion\">Religion</a> skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.</p><h5>Arcana</h5><p>Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.</p><h5>History</h5><p>Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.</p><h5>Investigation</h5><p>When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p><h5>Nature</h5><p>Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.</p><h5>Religion</h5><p>Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.</p><h5>Other Intelligence Checks</h5><p>The DM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul>\n<li>Communicate with a creature without using words</li>\n<li>Estimate the value of a precious item</li>\n<li>Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard</li>\n<li>Forge a document</li>\n<li>Recall lore about a craft or trade</li>\n<li>Win a game of skill</li>\n</ul><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4><p>Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p><h3>Wisdom</h3><p>Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.</p><h4>Wisdom Checks</h4><p>A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AnimalHandling\">Animal Handling</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Insight\">Insight</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Medicine\">Medicine</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival\">Survival</a> skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.</p><h5>Animal Handling</h5><p>When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the DM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.</p><h5>Insight</h5><p>Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.</p><h5>Medicine</h5><p>A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.</p><h5>Perception</h5><p>Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.</p><aside>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"finding-a-hidden-object\"><strong>FINDING A HIDDEN OBJECT</strong></p>\n<p>When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.</p>\n<p>In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside><h5>Survival</h5><p>The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.</p><h5>Other Wisdom Checks</h5><p>The DM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul>\n<li>Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</li>\n<li>Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead</li>\n</ul><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4><p>Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p><h3>Charisma</h3><p>Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.</p><h4>Charisma Checks</h4><p>A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Deception\">Deception</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Intimidation\">Intimidation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Performance\">Performance</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Persuasion\">Persuasion</a> skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.</p><h5>Deception</h5><p>Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.</p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/668/c72.png\"></p><h5>Intimidation</h5><p>When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.</p><h5>Performance</h5><p>Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.</p><h5>Persuasion</h5><p>When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.</p><h5>Other Charisma Checks</h5><p>The DM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul>\n<li>Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip</li>\n<li>Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation</li>\n</ul><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4><p>Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p><h2>Saving Throws</h2><p>A saving throw — also called a save — represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.</p><p>To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.</p><p>A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the DM.</p><p>Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.</p><p>The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.</p><p>The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.</p>","img":null}

In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect — in most cases, all in the span of seconds.</p><p>Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions, drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.</p><p>Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse's history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.</p><h3>Spell Level</h3><p>Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell's level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"magic missile\">magic missile</a> at 1st level and the earth-shaking <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wish\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"wish\">wish</a> at 9th. Cantrips — simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote — are level 0. The higher a spell's level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.</p><p>Spell level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.</p></div>","img":null}

In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.</p><p><strong>Alchemist's Fire.</strong> This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.</p><p><strong>Antitoxin.</strong> A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.</p><p><strong>Arcane Focus.</strong> An arcane focus is a special item — an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item — designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus, as described in <a title=\"Components\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting#Components\">chapter 10</a>.</p><p><strong>Ball Bearings.</strong> As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a>. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.</p><p><strong>Block and Tackle.</strong> A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.</p><p><strong>Book.</strong> A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).</p><p><strong>Caltrops.</strong> As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature's walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.</p><p><strong>Candle.</strong> For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</p><p><strong>Case, Crossbow Bolt.</strong> This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts.</p><p><strong>Case, Map or Scroll.</strong> This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.</p><p><strong>Chain.</strong> A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.</p><p><strong>Climber's Kit.</strong> A climber's kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber's kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can't fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can't climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.</p><p><strong>Component Pouch.</strong> A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description).</p><p><strong>Crowbar.</strong> Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar's leverage can be applied.</p><p><strong>Druidic Focus.</strong> A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus, as described in <a title=\"Components\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting#Components\">chapter 10</a>.</p><p><strong>Fishing Tackle.</strong> This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting.</p><p><strong>Healer's Kit.</strong> This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Medicine\">Medicine</a>) check.</p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/728/c58.png\"></p><p><strong>Holy Symbol.</strong> A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus, as described in <a title=\"Components\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting#Components\">chapter 10</a>. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.</p><p><strong>Holy Water.</strong> As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.</p><p>A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.</p><p><strong>Hunting Trap.</strong> When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.</p><p><strong>Lamp.</strong> A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.</p><p><strong>Lantern, Bullseye.</strong> A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.</p><p><strong>Lantern, Hooded.</strong> A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.</p><p><strong>Lock.</strong> A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your DM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.</p><p><strong>Magnifying Glass.</strong> This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.</p><p><strong>Manacles.</strong> These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick the manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.</p><p><strong>Mess Kit.</strong> This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.</p><p><strong>Oil.</strong> Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.</p><p><strong>Poison, Basic.</strong> You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/potion-of-healing\">Potion of Healing</a>. A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.</p><p><strong>Pouch.</strong> A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section).</p><p><strong>Quiver.</strong> A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.</p><p><strong>Ram, Portable.</strong> You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.</p><p><strong>Rations.</strong> Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.</p><p><strong>Rope.</strong> Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.</p><p><strong>Scale, Merchant's.</strong> A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.</p><p><strong>Spellbook.</strong> Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.</p><p><strong>Spyglass.</strong> Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.</p><p><strong>Tent.</strong> A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.</p><p><strong>Tinderbox.</strong> This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch — or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel — takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.</p><p><strong>Torch.</strong> A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.</p><h3>Container Capacity</h3><div><table class=\"compendium-gear-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"gearcontainername\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Container</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Capacity</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Backpack*</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 cubic foot/30 pounds of gear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Barrel</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">40 gallons liquid, 4 cubic feet solid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Basket</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2 cubic feet/40 pounds of gear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Bottle</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 1/2 pints liquid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Bucket</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">3 gallons liquid, 1/2 cubic foot solid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Chest</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">12 cubic feet/300 pounds gear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Flask or tankard</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 pint liquid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Jug or pitcher</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 gallon liquid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Pot, iron</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 gallon liquid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Pouch</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1/5 cubic foot/6 pounds of gear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Sack</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 cubic foot/30 pounds of gear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Vial</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4 ounces liquid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Waterskin</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4 pints liquid</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p><br>* You can also strap items, such as a bedroll or a coil of rope, to the outside of a backpack.</p></div>","img":null,"_id":"VowBU08ejlfCudQU"}

Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a race (such as human or halfling) and a class (such as fighter or wizard). You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons world.</p><p>Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a courageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a flamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar. Do you like fantasy fiction featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of one of those races. Do you want your character to be the toughest adventurer at the table? Consider the fighter class. If you don’t know where else to begin, take a look at the illustrations in any Dungeons &amp; Dragons book to see what catches your interest.</p><p>Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. Your conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What’s important is that you come to the table with a character you’re excited to play.</p><p>Throughout this chapter, we use the term <b>character sheet</b> to mean whatever you use to track your character, whether it’s a formal character sheet (like the one at the end of these rules), some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper. An official D&amp;D character sheet is a fine place to start until you know what information you need and how you use it during the game.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>BUILDING BRUENOR</strong></p>\n<p>Each step of character creation includes an example of that step, with a player named Bob building his dwarf character, Bruenor.</p>\n</blockquote><h2>1. Choose a Race</h2><div>\n<p>Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the D&amp;D world. The most common player character races are dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. Some races also have <b>subraces</b>, such as mountain dwarf or wood elf, as well as the less widespread races of dragonborn, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, and tieflings. <a title=\"Races\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/races\">Chapter 2</a>&nbsp;provides more information about these races.</p>\n<p>The race you choose contributes to your character’s identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be powerful wizards. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too. Halfling paladins and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.</p>\n<p>Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and remember to apply them later.</p>\n<p>Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet. Be sure to note your starting languages and your base speed as well.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"compendium-first-line-blockquote\">\n<p><strong>BUILDING BRUENOR, STEP 1</strong></p>\n<p>Bob is sitting down to create his character. He decides that a gruff mountain dwarf fits the character he wants to play. He notes all the racial traits of dwarves on his character sheet, including his speed of 25 feet and the languages he knows: Common and Dwarvish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><h2>2. Choose a Class</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/609/ch1bruenor.png\"></p><div>\n<p>Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in chapter 3, \"<a title=\"Classes\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/classes\">Classes</a>.\"</p>\n<p>Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are <b>class features&nbsp;</b>— capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of <b>proficiencies</b>: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.</p>\n<p>On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Level\">Level</h3>\n<p>Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining <b>experience points</b> (XP). A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.</p>\n<p>Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar with the game, or if you are joining an existing D&amp;D campaign, your DM might decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing adventures.</p>\n<p>Record your level on your character sheet. If you’re starting at a higher level, record the additional elements your class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also record your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0 XP. A higher-level character typically begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level (see “<a title=\"Beyond 1st Level\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/step-by-step-characters#Beyond1stLevel\">Beyond 1st Level</a>” later in this chapter).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>QUICK BUILD</strong></p>\n<p>Each class description in <a title=\"Classes\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/classes\">chapter 3</a>&nbsp;includes a section offering suggestions to quickly build a character of that class, including how to assign your highest ability scores, a background suitable to the class, and starting spells.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"HitPointsandHitDice\">Hit Points and Hit Dice</h3>\n<p>Your character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).</p>\n<p>At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your <b>hit point maximum</b>.</p>\n<p>Record your character’s hit points on your character sheet. Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see “<a title=\"Resting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring#Resting\">Resting</a>” in chapter 8, \"<a title=\"Adventuring\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring\">Adventuring</a>\").</p>\n<h3 id=\"ProficiencyBonus\">Proficiency Bonus</h3>\n<p>The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attack rolls using weapons you’re proficient with</li>\n<li>Attack rolls with spells you cast</li>\n<li>Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in</li>\n<li>Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with</li>\n<li>Saving throws you’re proficient in</li>\n<li>Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting class)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in chapter 7, \"<a title=\"Using Ability Scores\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/using-ability-scores\">Using Ability Scores</a>\", and tools in chapter 5, \"<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#Tools\">Equipment</a>.\") Your background gives you additional skill and tool proficiencies, and some races give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.</p>\n<p>Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"compendium-first-line-blockquote\">\n<p><strong>BUILDING BRUENOR, STEP 2</strong></p>\n<p>Bob imagines Bruenor charging into battle with an axe, one horn on his helmet broken off. He makes Bruenor a fighter and notes the fighter’s proficiencies and 1st-level class features on his character sheet.</p>\n<p>As a 1st-level fighter, Bruenor has 1 Hit Die—a d10—and starts with hit points equal to 10 + his Constitution modifier. Bob notes this, and will record the final number after he determines Bruenor’s Constitution score (see step 3). Bob also notes the proficiency bonus for a 1st-level character, which is +2.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><h2>3. Determine Ability Scores</h2><div>\n<p>Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: <b>Strength</b>, <b>Dexterity</b>, <b>Constitution</b>, <b>Intelligence</b>, <b>Wisdom</b>, and <b>Charisma</b>. Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.</p>\n<p>The six abilities and their use in the game are described in <a title=\"Using Ability Scores\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/using-ability-scores\">chapter 7</a>. The Ability Score Summary table provides a quick reference for what qualities are measured by each ability, what races increases which abilities, and what classes consider each ability particularly important.</p>\n<p>You generate your character’s six <b>ability scores</b> randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to save time or don’t like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.</p>\n<p>Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character’s six abilities to assign scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores as a result of your race choice.</p>\n<p>After assigning your ability scores, determine your <b>ability modifiers</b> using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"compendium-first-line-blockquote\">\n<p><strong>BUILDING BRUENOR, STEP 3</strong></p>\n<p>Bob decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for Bruenor’s abilities. Since he’s a fighter, he puts his highest score, 15, in Strength. His next-highest, 14, goes in Constitution. Bruenor might be a brash fighter, but Bob decides he wants the dwarf to be older, wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent scores in Wisdom and Charisma. After applying his racial benefits (increasing Bruenor’s Constitution by 2 and his Strength by 2), Bruenor’s ability scores and modifiers look like this: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (–1), Wisdom 13 (+1), Charisma 12 (+1).</p>\n<p>Bob fills in Bruenor’s final hit points: 10 + his Constitution modifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit points.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"VariantCustomizingAbilityScores\">Variant: Customizing Ability Scores</h3>\n<p>At your Dungeon Master’s option, you can use this variant for determining your ability scores. The method described here allows you to build a character with a set of ability scores you choose individually.</p>\n<p>You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying racial increases. You can’t have a score lower than 8.</p>\n<p>This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of numbers between those extremes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"AbilityScorePointCost\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Ability Score Point Cost</h4>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\"><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"731322389\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[SoBB7Vxaixg4Us5x]{Cost}</span></div></div></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"AbilityScoreSummary\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Ability Score Summary</h4>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Strength</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top;

Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or she behaves in general terms.</p>\n<p>Using the information in the chapter 4 \"<a title=\"Personality and Background\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/personality-and-background\">Personality and Background</a>,\" you can flesh out your character’s physical appearance and personality traits. Choose your character’s <b>alignment</b> (the moral compass that guides his or her decisions) and <b>ideals</b>. <a title=\"Personality and Background\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/personality-and-background\">Chapter 4</a>&nbsp;also helps you identify the things your character holds most dear, called <b>bonds</b>, and the <b>flaws</b> that could one day undermine him or her.</p>\n<p>Your character’s <b>background</b> describes where he or she came from, his or her original occupation, and the character’s place in the D&amp;D world. Your DM might offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included in <a title=\"Personality and Background\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/personality-and-background\">chapter 4</a>, and might be willing to work with you to craft a background that’s a more precise fit for your character concept.</p>\n<p>A background gives your character a background feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, and it might also give you additional languages or proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this information, along with the personality information you develop, on your character sheet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"YourCharactersAbilities\">Your Character's Abilities</h3>\n<p>Take your character’s ability scores and race into account as you flesh out his or her appearance and personality. A very strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart character with low Strength.</p>\n<p>For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might be scrawny or plump.</p>\n<p>A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.</p>\n<p>A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy.

Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in that chapter. If you wish, you can also have one trinket at no cost (see the \"<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#Trinkets\">Trinkets</a>\" table at the end of <a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment\">chapter 5</a>).</p>\n<p>Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry.

Things that contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters wear armor or carry shields, however.</p>\n<p>Without armor or a shield, your character’s AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier.

Come Together</h2><div>\n<p>Most D&amp;D characters don’t work alone. Each character plays a role within a <b>party</b>, a group of adventurers working together for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party’s chances to survive the many perils in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Talk to your fellow players and your DM to decide whether your characters know one another, how they met, and what sorts of quests the group might undertake.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/3/290/c0-03.png\"></p>\n</div><h2>Beyond 1st Level</h2><p>As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called <strong>gaining a level</strong>.</p><h3>Class Features and Hit Dice</h3><p>When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.</p><p>Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).</p><p>When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level fighter has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.</p><h3>XP and Proficiency Bonus&nbsp;Progression</h3><p>The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your character's class description to see what other improvements you gain at each level.</p><h3>Tiers of Play</h3><p>The shading in the Character Advancement table shows the four tiers of play. The tiers don’t have any rules associated with them; they are a general description of how the play experience changes as characters gain levels.</p><p>In the <strong>first tier</strong> (levels 1–4), characters are effectively apprentice adventurers. They are learning the features that define them as members of particular classes, including the major choices that flavor their class features as they advance (such as a wizard’s Arcane Tradition or a fighter’s Martial Archetype). The threats they face are relatively minor, usually posing a danger to local farmsteads or villages.</p><p>In the <strong>second tier</strong> (levels 5–10), characters come into their own. Many spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level spells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold of magical power with spells such as <span class=\"italic\">fireball</span> and <span class=\"italic\">lightning bolt</span>. At this tier, many weapon-using classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in one round. These characters have become important, facing dangers that threaten cities and kingdoms.</p><p>In the <strong>third tier</strong> (levels 11–16), characters have reached a level of power that sets them high above the ordinary populace and makes them special even among adventurers. At 11th level, many spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells, some of which create effects previously impossible for player characters to achieve. Other characters gain features that allow them to make more attacks or do more impressive things with those attacks. These mighty adventurers often confront threats to whole regions and continents.</p><p>At the <strong>fourth tier</strong> (levels 17–20), characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic (or villainous) archetypes in their own right. The fate of the world or even the fundamental order of the multiverse might hang in the balance during their adventures.</p><h4>Character Advancement</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1213629579\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[85D737JAMdDf7s1m]{Experience Points: Experience Points}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1213629580\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[hhvENBqf8zz468CI]{Experience Points: Level}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1213629581\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[yhynMcJOF0nzR8zd]{Experience Points: Proficiency Bonus}</span></div></div></div>","img":null}
{"_id":"Zqzn6AAckd4Qduwq","name":"01 Preface","permission":{"default":0,"DJNYgTCLxATVgLjS":3},"folder":"","flags":{"vtta":{"name":"01 Preface","sceneId":null}},"content":"<h1>Preface</h1><blockquote>\n<p>Once upon a time, long, long ago, in a&nbsp;realm called the Midwestern United States — specifically the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin — a group of friends gathered together to forever alter the history of gaming.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t their intent to do so. They were tired of merely reading tales about worlds of magic, monsters, and adventure. They wanted to play in those worlds, rather than observe them. That they went on to&nbsp; invent&nbsp;Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and thereby ignite a revolution in gaming that continues to this day, speaks to two things.</p>\n<p>First, it speaks to their ingenuity and genius in figuring out that games were the perfect way to explore worlds that could not otherwise exist. Almost every modern game, whether played on a digital device or a tabletop, owes some&nbsp;debt to D&amp;D.</p>\n<p>Second, it is a testament to the inherent appeal of the game they created.&nbsp;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;sparked a thriving global phenomenon. It is the first roleplaying game, and it remains one of the best&nbsp;of its breed.</p>\n<p>To play D&amp;D, and to play it well, you don’t need to read all the rules, memorize every detail of the game, or master the fine art of rolling funny looking dice. None of those things have any bearing on what’s best about the game.</p>\n<p>What you need are two things, the first being friends with whom you can share the game. Playing games with your friends is a lot of fun, but D&amp;D does something more than entertain.</p>\n<p>Playing D&amp;D is an exercise in collaborative creation. You and your friends create epic stories filled with tension and memorable drama. You create silly in-jokes that make you laugh years later. The dice will be cruel to you, but you will soldier on. Your collective creativity will build stories that you will tell again and again, ranging from the utterly absurd to the stuff of legend.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have friends interested in playing, don’t worry. There’s a special alchemy that takes place around a D&amp;D table that nothing else can match. Play the game with someone enough, and the two of you are likely to end up friends. It’s a cool side effect of the game. Your next gaming group is as close as the nearest game store, online forum, or gaming convention.</p>\n<p>The second thing you need is a lively imagination or, more importantly, the willingness to use whatever imagination you have. You don’t need to be a master storyteller or a brilliant artist. You just need to aspire to create, to have the courage of someone who is willing to build something and share it&nbsp;with others.</p>\n<p>Luckily, just as D&amp;D can strengthen your friendships, it can help build in you the confidence to create and share. D&amp;D is a game that teaches you to look for the clever solution, share the sudden idea that can overcome a problem, and push yourself to imagine what could be, rather than simply accept what is.</p>\n<p>The first characters and adventures you create will probably be a collection of clichés. That’s true of everyone, from the greatest Dungeon Masters in history on down. Accept this reality and move on to create the second character or adventure, which will be better, and then the third, which will be better still. Repeat that over the course of time, and soon you’ll be able to create anything, from a character’s background story to an epic world of fantasy adventure.</p>\n<p>Once you have that skill, it’s yours forever. Countless writers, artists, and other creators can trace their beginnings to a few pages of D&amp;D notes, a handful of dice, and a kitchen table.</p>\n<p>Above all else, D&amp;D is yours. The friendships you make around the table will be unique to you. The adventures you embark on, the characters you create, the memories you make—these will be yours. D&amp;D is your personal corner of the universe, a place where you have free reign to do&nbsp;as you wish.</p>\n<p>Go forth now. Read the rules of the game and the story of its worlds, but always remember that you are the one who brings them to life. They are nothing without the spark of life that you give them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Mike Mearls<br>May 2014</p>\n</blockquote><h1>Introduction</h1><p>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games, D&amp;D is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents.</p><div>\n<blockquote class=\"adventure-read-aloud-text\">\n<p><strong>Dungeon Master (DM):</strong> After passing through the craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east and Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling towers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach. They look like abandoned guardhouses. Beyond these, a wide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep fog below. A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm, leading to an arched entrance to the castle courtyard. The chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind, their rust-eaten iron straining with the weight. From atop the high strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you from hollow sockets and grin hideously. A rotting wooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs in the entry tunnel. Beyond this, the main doors of Castle Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into the courtyard.</p>\n<p><strong>Phillip (playing Gareth):</strong> I want to look at the gargoyles. I have a feeling they’re not just statues.</p>\n<p><strong>Amy (playing Riva):</strong> The drawbridge looks precarious? I want to see how sturdy it is. Do I think we can cross it, or is it going to collapse under our weight?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><p>Unlike a game of make-believe, D&amp;D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers’ action. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical lightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.</p><div>\n<blockquote class=\"adventure-read-aloud-text\">\n<p><strong>Dungeon Master (DM): </strong>OK, one at a time. Phillip, you’re looking at the gargoyles?</p>\n<p><strong>Phillip: </strong>Yeah. Is there any hint they might be creatures and not decorations?</p>\n<p><strong>DM:</strong> Make an Intelligence check.</p>\n<p><strong>Phillip: </strong>Does my Investigation skill apply?</p>\n<p><strong>DM: </strong>Sure!</p>\n<p><strong>Phillip (rolling a d20): </strong>Ugh. Seven.</p>\n<p><strong>DM: </strong>They look like decorations to you. And Amy, Riva is checking out the drawbridge?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><p>In the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends). Working together, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious mountain. The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover fabulous magic items and other treasure.</p><p>One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon Master (DM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The DM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM might describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do. Will they walk across the dangerously weathered drawbridge? Tie themselves together with rope to minimize the chance that someone will fall if the drawbridge gives way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm?</p><p>Then the DM determines the results of the adventurers’ actions and narrates what they experience. Because the DM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&amp;D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.</p><p>The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a <strong>campaign</strong>. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow in might as the campaign continues. Each monster defeated, each adventure completed, and each treasure recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an adventurer’s level.</p><p>There’s no winning and losing in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood. Together, the DM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, or the player might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.</p><h2>Worlds of Adventure</h2><p>The many worlds of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game are places of magic and monsters, of brave warriors and spectacular adventures. They begin with a foundation of medieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places, and magic that make these worlds unique.</p><p>The worlds of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game exist within a vast cosmos called the <strong>multiverse</strong>, connected in strange and mysterious ways to one another and to other planes of existence, such as the Elemental Plane of Fire and the Infinite Depths of the Abyss. Within this multiverse are an endless variety of worlds. Many of them have been published as official settings for the D&amp;D game. The legends of the Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron settings are woven together in the fabric of the multiverse. Alongside these worlds are hundreds of thousands more, created by generations of D&amp;D players for their own games. And amid all the richness of the multiverse, you might create a world of your own.</p><p>All these worlds share characteristics, but each world is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive monsters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dungeons, and scheming villains. Some races have unusual traits in different worlds. The halflings of the Dark Sun setting, for example, are jungle-dwelling cannibals, and the elves are desert nomads. Some worlds feature races unknown in other settings, such as Eberron’s warforged, soldiers created and imbued with life to fight in the Last War. Some worlds are dominated by one great story, like the War of the Lance that plays a central role in the Dragonlance setting. But they’re all D&amp;D worlds, and you can use the rules here to create a character and play in any one of them.</p><p>Your DM might set the campaign on one of these worlds or on one that he or she created. Because there is so much diversity among the worlds of D&amp;D, you should check with your DM about any house rules that will affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Dungeon Master is the authority on the campaign and its setting, even if the setting is a published world.</p><h2>Using This Book</h2><div>\n<p>The <em>Player's Handbook</em>&nbsp;is&nbsp;divided into three parts.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Part 1</span></strong> (chapters 1–6) is about creating a character, providing the rules and guidance you need to make the character you’ll play in the game. It includes information on the various races, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and other customization options that you can choose from. Many of the rules in part 1 rely on material in parts 2 and 3. If you come across a game concept in part 1 that you don’t understand, consult the book’s index.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Part 2</span></strong> (chapters 7–9) details the rules of how to play the game, beyond the basics described in this introduction. That part covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine success or failure at the tasks your character attempts, and describes the three broad categories of activity in the game: exploration, interaction, and combat.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Part 3</span></strong> (chapters 10–11) is all about magic. It covers the nature of magic in the worlds of D&amp;D, the rules for spellcasting, and the huge variety of spells available to magic-using characters (and monsters) in the game.</p>\n</div><h2>How to Play</h2><div>\n<p>The play of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game unfolds according to this basic pattern.</p>\n<p><b>1. The DM describes the environment.</b></p>\n<p>The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s around them, presenting the basic scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what’s on a table, who’s in the tavern, and so on).</p>\n<p><b>2. The players describe what they want to do.</b></p>\n<p>Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, “We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. The players don’t need to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.</p>\n<p><b>3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers’ actions.</b></p>\n<p>Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.</p>\n<p>This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured and the players (and DM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.</p>\n<p>Often the action of an adventure takes place in the imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM’s verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.</p>\n<h3 id=\"GameDice\">Game Dice</h3>\n<p>The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many bookstores.</p>\n<p>In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).</p>\n<p>Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.</p>\n<p>When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add. For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.</p>\n<p>The same d notation appears in the expressions “1d3” and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it’s a 2.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"TheD20\">The D20</h3>\n<p>Does an adventurer’s sword swing hurt a dragon or just bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball, or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.</p>\n<p>Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six <b>ability scores</b>. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the <b>ability modifiers</b> derived from them, are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or monster’s behalf.</p>\n<p>Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.</p>\n<img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/6/552/dice_1.png\">\n<p><b>1. Roll the die and add a modifier.</b></p>\n<p>Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill. (See <a title=\"Step-By-Step Characters\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/step-by-step-characters\">Chapter 1</a>&nbsp;for details on each ability and how to determine an ability’s modifier.)</p>\n<p><b>2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.</b></p>\n<p>A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.</p>\n<p><b>3. Compare the total to a target number.</b></p>\n<p>If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it’s a failure. The <b>DM</b> is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.</p>\n<p>The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a <b>Difficulty Class</b> (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an <b>Armor Class</b> (AC).</p>\n<p>This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&amp;D play. Chapter 7, \"<a title=\"Using Ability Scores\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/using-ability-scores\">Using Ability Scores</a>\" provides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the game.</p>\n<h3 id=\"AdvantageandDisadvantage\">Advantage and Disadvantage</h3>\n<p>Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p>\n<p>More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in <a title=\"Using Ability Scores\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/using-ability-scores\">chapter 7</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SpecificBeatsGeneral\">Specific Beats General</h3>\n<p>This compendium contains rules that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.</p>\n<p>Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many adventurers don’t have proficiency with longbows, but every wood elf does because of a racial trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For instance, an adventurer can’t normally pass through walls, but some spells make that possible. Magic accounts for most of the major exceptions to the rules.</p>\n<h3 id=\"RoundDown\">Round Down</h3>\n<p>There’s one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.</p>\n</div><h2>Adventures</h2><div>\n<p>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons game consists of a group of characters embarking on an adventure that the Dungeon Master presents to them. Each character brings particular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability scores and skills, class features, racial traits, equipment, and magic items. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of adventurers is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully complete the adventure.</p>\n<p>The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased off the shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the DM’s needs and desires. In either case, an adventure features a fantastic setting, whether it’s an underground dungeon, a crumbling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It features a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created and played by the other players at the table, as well as nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of an adventure’s action.</p>\n<p>Over the course of their adventures, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the adventurers and other creatures do their best to kill or capture each other in combat. At other times, the adventurers talk to another creature (or even a magical object) with a goal in mind. And often, the adventurers spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find something hidden, or unravel the current situation. Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the world, making decisions about which way to travel and what they’ll try to do next.</p>\n<p>Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges, and it might take no more than a single game session to complete. A long adventure can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other challenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end of an adventure is marked by the adventurers heading back to civilization to rest and enjoy the spoils of their labors.</p>\n<p>But that’s not the end of the story. You can think of an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made up of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series—a string of adventures joined together, with a consistent group of adventurers following the narrative from start to finish.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TheThreePillarsofAdventure\">The Three Pillars of Adventure</h3>\n<p>Adventurers can try to do anything their players can imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities in three broad categories: exploration, social interaction, and combat.</p>\n<p><b>Exploration</b> includes both the adventurers’ movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations that require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the characters spending a day crossing a rolling plain or an hour making their way through caverns underground. On the smallest scale, it could mean one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to see what happens.</p>\n<p><b>Social interaction</b> features the adventurers talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding that a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the goblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner, pleading for mercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading a talkative magic mirror to show a distant location to the adventurers.</p>\n<p>The rules in part 2 (especially \"<a title=\"Using Ability Scores\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/using-ability-scores\">Using Ability Scores</a>\"&nbsp;and \"<a title=\"Adventuring\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring\">Adventuring</a>\") support exploration and social interaction, as do many class features in \"<a title=\"Classes\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/classes\">Classes</a>\"&nbsp;and personality traits in \"<a title=\"Personality and Background\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/personality-and-background\">Personality and Background</a>.\"</p>\n<p><b>Combat</b>, the focus of <a title=\"Combat\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat\">chapter 9</a>, involves characters and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells, maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat is the most structured element of a D&amp;D session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle, there’s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to attempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs on a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by pulling a mysterious lever), and to interact with other creatures, including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TheWondersofMagic\">The Wonders of Magic</h3>\n<p>Few D&amp;D adventures end without something magical happening. Whether helpful or harmful, magic appears frequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is the focus of <a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting\">part 3</a>.</p>\n<p>In the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, practitioners of magic are rare, set apart from the masses of people by their extraordinary talent. Common folk might see evidence of magic on a regular basis, but it’s usually minor—a fantastic monster, a visibly answered prayer, a wizard walking through the streets with an animated shield guardian as a bodyguard.</p>\n<p>For adventurers, though, magic is key to their survival. Without the healing magic of clerics and paladins, adventurers would quickly succumb to their wounds. Without the uplifting magical support of bards and clerics, warriors might be overwhelmed by powerful foes. Without the sheer magical power and versatility of wizards and druids, every threat would be magnified tenfold.</p>\n<p>Magic is also a favored tool of villains. Many adventures are driven by the machinations of spellcasters who are hellbent on using magic for some ill end. A cult leader seeks to awaken a god who slumbers beneath the sea, a hag kidnaps youths to magically drain them of their vigor, a mad wizard labors to invest an army of automatons with a facsimile of life, a dragon begins a mystical ritual to rise up as a god of destruction—these are just a few of the magical threats that adventurers might face. With magic of their own, in the form of spells and magic items, the adventurers might prevail!</p>\n</div><img>","img":null}
{"_id":"a7jZXKtfAdwfKWFW","name":"03 Chapter 2: Races","permission":{"default":0,"DJNYgTCLxATVgLjS":3},"folder":"","flags":{"vtta":{"name":"03 Chapter 2: Races","sceneId":null}},"content":"<h1>Chapter 2: Races</h1><p>A visit to one of the great cities in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;— Waterdeep, the Free City of Greyhawk, or even uncanny Sigil, the City of Doors — overwhelms the senses. Voices chatter in countless different languages. The smells of cooking in dozens of different cuisines mingle with the odors of crowded streets and poor sanitation. Buildings in myriad architectural styles display the diverse origins of their inhabitants.</p><p>And the people themselves — people of varying size, shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum of styles and hues — represent many different races, from diminutive halflings and stout dwarves to majestically beautiful elves, mingling among a variety of human ethnicities.</p><p>Scattered among the members of these more common races are the true exotics: a hulking dragonborn here, pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly tiefling there, lurking in the shadows with mischief in her eyes. A group of gnomes laughs as one of them activates a clever wooden toy that moves of its own accord. Half-elves and half-orcs live and work alongside humans, without fully belonging to the races of either of their parents. And there, well out of the sunlight, is a lone drow — a fugitive from the subterranean expanse of the Underdark, trying to make his way in a world that fears his kind.</p><h2>Choosing a Race</h2><p>Humans are the most common people in the worlds of D&amp;D, but they live and work alongside dwarves, elves, halflings, and countless other fantastic species. Your character belongs to one of these peoples.</p><p>Not every intelligent race of the multiverse is appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. Dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans are the most common races to produce the sort of adventurers who make up typical parties. Dragonborn, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, and tieflings are less common as adventurers. Drow, a subrace of elves, are also uncommon.</p><p>Your choice of race affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character’s adventuring career. When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play. For example, a halfling could be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes a tough warrior, and an elf can be a master of arcane magic.</p><p>Your character race not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character’s story. Each race’s description in this chapter includes information to help you roleplay a character of that race, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies. These details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for their race. It’s worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character’s background and personality.</p><h2>Racial Traits</h2><p>The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races.</p><h3>Ability Score Increase</h3><p>Every race increases one or more of a character’s ability scores.</p><h3>Age</h3><p>The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.</p><h3>Alignment</h3><p>Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.</p><h3>Size</h3><p>Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in <a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment\">chapter 5</a>.</p><h3>Speed</h3><p>Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (chapter 8, “<a title=\"Adventuring\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring\">Adventuring</a>”) and fighting (chapter 9,&nbsp;“<a title=\"Combat\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat\">Combat</a>”).</p><h3>Languages</h3><p>By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages. Chapter 4, “<a title=\"Personality and Background\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/personality-and-background\">Personality and Background</a>” lists the most common languages of the D&amp;D multiverse.</p><h3>Subraces</h3><p>Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race and world to world. In the Dragonlance campaign setting, for example, mountain dwarves and hill dwarves live together as different clans of the same people, but in the Forgotten Realms, they live far apart in separate kingdoms and call themselves shield dwarves and gold dwarves, respectively.</p><h2>Dwarf</h2><p><img class=\"compendium-header-banner-img\" src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/619/850/190/dwarfintro.png\" alt=\"\"></p><p><img src=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/612/dwarf.png\"></p><blockquote>\n<p>“Yer late, elf!” came the rough edge of a familiar voice. Bruenor Battlehammer walked up the back of his dead foe, disregarding the fact that the heavy monster lay on top of his elven friend. In spite of the added discomfort, the dwarf’s long, pointed, often-broken nose and gray-streaked though still-fiery red beard came as a welcome sight to Drizzt. “Knew I’d find ye in trouble if I came out an’ looked for ye!”</p>\n<p><em>— R. A. Salvatore, </em><em>The Crystal Shard</em></p>\n</blockquote><p>Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs — these common threads unite all dwarves.</p><h3>Short and Stout</h3><p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.</p><p>Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.</p><h3>Long Memory, Long Grudges</h3><p>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p><p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don’t abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.</p><p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p><h3>Clans and Kingdoms</h3><p><img src=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/615/dwarf2.png\"></p><p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.</p><p>The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.</p><p>Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.</p><h3>Gods, Gold, and Clan</h3><p><img src=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/618/dwarf1.png\"></p><p>Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure — for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>SLOW TO TRUST</strong></p>\n<p>Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. “The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years,” is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member of a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf’s trust.</p>\n<p><em><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Italic-Sans-Serif\">Elves. </span></strong></em>“It’s not wise to depend on the elves. No telling what an elf will do next; when the hammer meets the orc’s head, they’re as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword. They’re flighty and frivolous. Two things to be said for them, though: They don’t have many smiths, but the ones they have do very fine work. And when orcs or goblins come streaming down out of the mountains, an elf’s good to have at your back. Not as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt they hate the orcs as much as we do.”</p>\n<p><em><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Italic-Sans-Serif\">Halflings. </span></strong></em>“Sure, they’re pleasant folk. But show me a halfling hero. An empire, a triumphant army. Even a treasure for the ages made by halfling hands. Nothing. How can you take them seriously?”</p>\n<p><em><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Italic-Sans-Serif\">Humans. </span></strong></em>“You take the time to get to know a human, and by then the human’s on her deathbed. If you’re lucky, she’s got kin — a daughter or granddaughter, maybe — who’s got hands and heart as good as hers. That’s when you can make a human friend. And watch them go! They set their hearts on something, they’ll get it, whether it’s a dragon’s hoard or an empire’s throne. You have to admire that kind of dedication, even if it gets them in trouble more often than not.”</p>\n</blockquote><h3>Dwarf Names</h3><p>A dwarf’s name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance with tradition. Every proper dwarven name has been used and reused down through the generations. A dwarf’s name belongs to the clan, not to the individual. A dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name is stripped of the name and forbidden by law to use any dwarven name in its place.</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Male Names:</span></strong> Adrik, Alberich, Baern, Barendd, Brottor, Bruenor, Dain, Darrak, Delg, Eberk, Einkil, Fargrim, Flint, Gardain, Harbek, Kildrak, Morgran, Orsik, Oskar, Rangrim, Rurik, Taklinn, Thoradin, Thorin, Tordek, Traubon, Travok, Ulfgar, Veit, Vondal</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Female Names:</span> </strong>Amber, Artin, Audhild, Bardryn, Dagnal, Diesa, Eldeth, Falkrunn, Finellen, Gunnloda, Gurdis, Helja, Hlin, Kathra, Kristryd, Ilde, Liftrasa, Mardred, Riswynn, Sannl, Torbera, Torgga, Vistra</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Clan Names:</span></strong> Balderk, Battlehammer, Brawnanvil, Dankil, Fireforge, Frostbeard, Gorunn, Holderhek, Ironfist, Loderr, Lutgehr, Rumnaheim, Strakeln, Torunn, Ungart</p><h3>Dwarf Traits</h3><p>Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Ability Score Increase.</span> Your Constitution score increases by 2.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Age. </span>Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Alignment. </span>Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Size.</span> Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Speed.</span> Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Darkvision.</span> Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Dwarven Resilience. </span>You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage (explained in chapter 9, “<a title=\"Combat\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat\">Combat</a>”).</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Dwarven Combat Training.</span> You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Tool Proficiency.</span> You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Stonecunning. </span>Whenever you make an Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#History\">History</a>) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#History\">History</a> skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Languages.</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Subrace.</span> Two main subraces of dwarves populate the worlds of D&amp;D: hill dwarves and mountain dwarves. Choose one of these subraces.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>DUERGAR</strong></p>\n<p>In cities deep in the Underdark live the duergar, or gray dwarves. These vicious, stealthy slave traders raid the surface world for captives, then sell their prey to the other races of the Underdark. They have innate magical abilities to become <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible\">invisible</a> and to temporarily grow to giant size.</p>\n</blockquote><h3>Hill Dwarf</h3><p>As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience. The gold dwarves of Faerûn in their mighty southern kingdom are hill dwarves, as are the exiled Neidar and the debased Klar of Krynn in the Dragonlance setting.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Ability Score Increase. </span>Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Dwarven Toughness.</span> Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.</p><h3>Mountain Dwarf</h3><p>As a mountain dwarf, you’re strong and hardy, accustomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. You’re probably on the tall side (for a dwarf), and tend toward lighter coloration. The shield dwarves of northern Faerûn, as well as the ruling Hylar clan and the noble Daewar clan of Dragonlance, are mountain dwarves.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Ability Score Increase.</span> Your Strength score increases by 2.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Dwarven Armor Training.</span> You have proficiency with light and medium armor.</p><h2>Elf</h2><p><img class=\"compendium-header-banner-img\" src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/621/elfintro.png\" alt=\"\"></p><p><img src=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/620/elf.png\"></p><blockquote>\n<p>“I have never imagined such beauty existed,” Goldmoon said softly. The day’s march had been difficult, but the reward at the end was beyond their dreams. The companions stood on a high cliff over the fabled city of Qualinost.</p>\n<p>Four slender spires rose from the city’s corners like glistening spindles, their brilliant white stone marbled with shining silver. Graceful arches, swooping from spire to spire, soared through the air. Crafted by ancient dwarven metalsmiths, they were strong enough to hold the weight of an army, yet they appeared so delicate that a bird lighting on them might overthrow the balance. These glistening arches were the city’s only boundaries; there was no wall around Qualinost. The elven city opened its arms lovingly to the wilderness.</p>\n<p><em>— Margaret Weis &amp; Tracy Hickman,&nbsp;Dragons of Autumn Twilight</em></p>\n</blockquote><p>Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.</p><h3>Slender and Graceful</h3><p>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.</p><p>Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.</p><h3>A Timeless Perspective</h3><p><img src=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/623/elf1.png\"></p><p>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.</p><p>Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</p><h3>Hidden Woodland Realms</h3><p><img src=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/624/elf2.png\"></p><p>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).</p><p>Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.</p><h3>Exploration and Adventure</h3><p>Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>HAUGHTY BUT GRACIOUS</strong></p>\n<p>Although they can be haughty, elves are generally gracious even to those who fall short of their high expectations—which is most non-elves. Still, they can find good in just about anyone.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dwarves</em>.</strong> “Dwarves are dull, clumsy oafs. But what they lack in humor, sophistication, and manners, they make up in valor. And I must admit, their best smiths produce art that approaches elven quality.”</p>\n<p><strong><em>Halflings.</em></strong> “Halflings are people of simple pleasures, and that is not a quality to scorn. They’re good folk, they care for each other and tend their gardens, and they have proven themselves tougher than they seem when the need arises.”</p>\n<p><strong><em>Humans.</em></strong> “All that haste, their ambition and drive to accomplish something before their brief lives pass away—human endeavors seem so futile sometimes. But then you look at what they have accomplished, and you have to appreciate their achievements. If only they could slow down and learn some refinement.”</p>\n</blockquote><h3>Elf Names</h3><p>Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday, and before this period they are called by child names.</p><p>On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Child Names:</span></strong> Ara, Bryn, Del, Eryn, Faen, Innil, Lael, Mella, Naill, Naeris, Phann, Rael, Rinn, Sai, Syllin, Thia, Vall</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Male Adult Names:</span></strong> Adran, Aelar, Aramil, Arannis, Aust, Beiro, Berrian, Carric, Enialis, Erdan, Erevan, Galinndan, Hadarai, Heian, Himo, Immeral, Ivellios, Laucian, Mindartis, Paelias, Peren, Quarion, Riardon, Rolen, Soveliss, Thamior, Tharivol, Theren, Varis</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Female Adult Names:</span></strong> Adrie, Althaea, Anastrianna, Andraste, Antinua, Bethrynna, Birel, Caelynn, Drusilia, Enna, Felosial, Ielenia, Jelenneth, Keyleth, Leshanna, Lia, Meriele, Mialee, Naivara, Quelenna, Quillathe, Sariel, Shanairra, Shava, Silaqui, Theirastra, Thia, Vadania, Valanthe, Xanaphia</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Family Names (Common Translations):</span></strong> Amakiir (Gemflower), Amastacia (Starflower), Galanodel (Moonwhisper), Holimion (Diamonddew), Ilphelkiir (Gemblossom), Liadon (Silverfrond), Meliamne (Oakenheel), Naïlo (Nightbreeze), Siannodel (Moonbrook), Xiloscient (Goldpetal)</p><h3>Elf Traits</h3><p><img src=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/649/elf4.jpg\"></p><p>Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Ability Score Increase. </span>Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Age.</span> Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Alignment.</span> Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Size.</span> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Speed.</span> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Darkvision.</span> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Keen Senses. </span></strong>You have proficiency in the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a> skill.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Fey Ancestry.</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a>, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Trance.</span> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Languages.</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Subrace. </span>Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. Choose one of these subraces. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>THE DARKNESS OF THE DROW</strong></p>\n<p>Were it not for one renowned exception, the race of drow would be universally reviled. To most, they are a race of demon-worshiping marauders dwelling in the subterranean depths of the Underdark, emerging only on the blackest nights to pillage and slaughter the surface dwellers they despise. Their society is depraved and preoccupied with the favor of Lolth, their spider-goddess, who sanctions murder and the extermination of entire families as noble houses vie for position.</p>\n<p>Yet one drow, at least, broke the mold. In the world of the Forgotten Realms, Drizzt Do’Urden, ranger of the North, has proven his quality as a good-hearted defender of the weak and innocent. Rejecting his heritage and adrift in a world that looks upon him with terror and loathing, Drizzt is a model for those few drow who follow in his footsteps, trying to find a life apart from the evil society of their Underdark homes.</p>\n<p>Drow grow up believing that surface-dwelling races are inferior, worthless except as slaves. Drow who develop a conscience or find it necessary to cooperate with members of other races find it hard to overcome that prejudice, especially when they are so often on the receiving end of hatred.</p>\n</blockquote><h3>High Elf</h3><p>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&amp;D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk, the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.</p><p>The sun elves of Faerûn (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Ability Score Increase.</span> Your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Elf Weapon Training. </span>You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Cantrip.</span> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Extra Language. </span>You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.</p><h3>Wood Elf</h3><p>As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerûn, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.</p><p>Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Ability Score Increase.</span> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Elf Weapon Training.</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Fleet of Foot.</span> Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Mask of the Wild.</span> You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p><h3>Dark Elf (Drow)</h3><p><img src=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/625/elf3.png\"></p><p>Descended from an earlier subrace of elves, the drow were banished from the surface world for following the goddess Lolth down the path of evil. Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow have skin that resembles charcoal or obsidian, as well as stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.</p><p>Drow adventurers are rare.

Regis was short, even by the standards of his diminutive race, with the fluff of his curly brown locks barely cresting the three-foot mark, but his belly was amply thickened by his love of a good meal, or several, as the opportunities presented themselves. The crooked stick that served as his fishing pole rose up above him, clenched between two of his toes, and hung out over the quiet lake, mirrored perfectly in the glassy surface of Maer Dualdon.</p>\n<p>— <em>R.A. Salvatore,</em><em> The Crystal Shard</em></p>\n</blockquote><p>The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings’ lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver.</p><h3>Small and Practical</h3><p>The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds.</p><p>Halflings’ skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors.</p><p>Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They’re concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.</p><h3>Kind and Curious</h3><p>Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They love discovering new things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing.</p><p>Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any living thing suffer. They are generous, happily sharing what they have even in lean times.</p><h3>Blend into the Crowd</h3><p>Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of humans, dwarves, or elves, making themselves valuable and welcome. The combination of their inherent stealth and their unassuming nature helps halflings to avoid unwanted attention.</p><p>Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.</p><h3>Pastoral Pleasantries</h3><p><img src=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/627/halfling1.png\"></p><p>Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities with large farms and well-kept groves. They rarely build kingdoms of their own or even hold much land beyond their quiet shires. They typically don’t recognize any sort of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to family elders to guide them. Families preserve their traditional ways despite the rise and fall of empires.</p><p>Many halflings live among other races, where the halflings’ hard work and loyal outlook offer them abundant rewards and creature comforts. Some halfling communities travel as a way of life, driving wagons or guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no permanent home.</p><h3>Exploring Opportunities</h3><p>Halflings usually set out on the adventurer’s path to defend their communities, support their friends, or explore a wide and wonder-filled world. For them, adventuring is less a career than an opportunity or sometimes a necessity.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>AFFABLE AND POSITIVE</strong></p>\n<p>Halflings try to get along with everyone else and are loath to make sweeping generalizations — especially negative ones.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dwarves.</em></strong> “Dwarves make loyal friends, and you can count on them to keep their word. But would it hurt them to smile once in a while?”</p>\n<p><strong><em>Elves.</em></strong> “They’re so beautiful! Their faces, their music, their grace and all. It’s like they stepped out of a wonderful dream. But there’s no telling what’s going on behind their smiling faces — surely more than they ever let on.”</p>\n<p><strong><em>Humans.</em></strong> “Humans are a lot like us, really. At least some of them are. Step out of the castles and keeps, go talk to the farmers and herders and you’ll find good, solid folk. Not that there’s anything wrong with the barons and soldiers — you have to admire their conviction. And by protecting their own lands, they protect us as well.”</p>\n</blockquote><h3>Halfling Names</h3><p>A halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly a nickname. Family names are often nicknames that stuck so tenaciously they have been passed down through the generations.</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Male Names: </span></strong>Alton, Ander, Cade, Corrin, Eldon, Errich, Finnan, Garret, Lindal, Lyle, Merric, Milo, Osborn, Perrin, Reed, Roscoe, Wellby</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Female Names:</span></strong> Andry, Bree, Callie, Cora, Euphemia, Jillian, Kithri, Lavinia, Lidda, Merla, Nedda, Paela, Portia, Seraphina, Shaena, Trym, Vani, Verna</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Family Names:</span></strong> Brushgather, Goodbarrel, Greenbottle, High-hill, Hilltopple, Leagallow, Tealeaf, Thorngage, Tosscobble, Underbough</p><h3>Halfling Traits</h3><p>Your halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other halflings.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Ability Score Increase.</span> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Age. </span>A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Alignment.</span> Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Size.</span> Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Speed.</span> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Lucky.</span> When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Brave.</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a>.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Halfling Nimbleness. </span>You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Languages.</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Subrace.</span> The two main kinds of halfling, lightfoot and stout, are more like closely related families than true subraces. Choose one of these subraces.</p><h3>Lightfoot</h3><p>As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be affable and get along well with others. In the Forgotten Realms, lightfoot halflings have spread the farthest and thus are the most common variety.</p><p>Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life. In the world of Greyhawk, these halflings are called hairfeet or tallfellows.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Ability Score Increase.</span> Your Charisma score increases by 1.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Naturally Stealthy.</span> You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.</p><h3>Stout</h3><p>As a stout halfling, you’re hardier than average and have some resistance to poison. Some say that stouts have dwarven blood. In the Forgotten Realms, these halflings are called stronghearts, and they’re most common in the south.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Ability Score Increase.</span> Your Constitution score increases by 1.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Stout Resilience.</span> You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.</p><h2>Human</h2><p><img class=\"compendium-header-banner-img\" src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/632/humanintro.png\" alt=\"\"></p><p><img src=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/629/human.png\"></p><blockquote>\n<p>These were the stories of a restless people who long ago took to the seas and rivers in longboats, first to pillage and terrorize, then to settle. Yet there was an energy, a love of adventure, that sang from every page. Long into the night Liriel read, lighting candle after precious candle.</p>\n<p>She’d never given much thought to humans, but these stories fascinated her. In these yellowed pages were tales of bold heroes, strange and fierce animals, mighty primitive gods, and a magic that was part and fabric of that distant land.</p>\n<p>— <em>Elaine Cunningham,</em><em> Daughter of the Drow</em></p>\n</blockquote><p>In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common races, late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that’s why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.</p><h3>A Broad Spectrum</h3><p>With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than other common races. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other lineages. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.</p><h3>Variety in All Things</h3><p><img src=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/630/human1.png\"></p><p>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human’s memory. They live fully in the present — making them well suited to the adventuring life — but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.</p><h3>Lasting Institutions</h3><p>Where a single elf or dwarf might take on the responsibility of guarding a special location or a powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and institutions for such purposes. While dwarf clans and halfling elders pass on the ancient traditions to each new generation, human temples, governments, libraries, and codes of law fix their traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream of immortality, but (except for those few who seek undeath or divine ascension to escape death’s clutches) they achieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when they are gone.</p><p>Although some humans can be xenophobic, in general their societies are inclusive. Human lands welcome large numbers of nonhumans compared to the proportion of humans who live in nonhuman lands.</p><h3>Exemplars of Ambition</h3><p>Humans who seek adventure are the most daring and ambitious members of a daring and ambitious race. They seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing power, wealth, and fame. More than other people, humans champion causes rather than territories or groups.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>EVERYONE'S SECOND-BEST FRIENDS</strong></p>\n<p>Just as readily as they mix with each other, humans mingle with members of other races. They get along with almost everyone, though they might not be close to many. Humans serve as ambassadors, diplomats, magistrates, merchants, and functionaries of all kinds.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dwarves.</em></strong> “They’re stout folk, stalwart friends, and true to their word. Their greed for gold is their downfall, though.”</p>\n<p><strong><em>Elves.</em></strong> “It’s best not to wander into elven woods. They don’t like intruders, and you’ll as likely be bewitched as peppered with arrows. Still, if an elf can get past that damned racial pride and actually treat you like an equal, you can learn a lot from them.”</p>\n<p><strong><em>Halflings.</em></strong> “It’s hard to beat a meal in a halfling home, as long as you don’t crack your head on the ceiling—good food and good stories in front of a nice, warm fire. If halflings had a shred of ambition, they might really amount to something.”</p>\n</blockquote><h3>Human Names and Ethnicities</h3><p><img src=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/631/human2.png\"></p><p>Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans as a whole have no typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less correctly), but most parents give names that are linked to their region’s culture or to the naming traditions of their ancestors.</p><p>The material culture and physical characteristics of humans can change wildly from region to region. In the Forgotten Realms, for example, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature are different in the northwestern lands of the Silver Marches than in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east — and even more distinctive in far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical characteristics, though, vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of the Silver Marches have every possible variation of coloration and features.</p><p>In the Forgotten Realms, nine human ethnic groups are widely recognized, though over a dozen others are found in more localized areas of Faerûn. These groups, and the typical names of their members, can be used as inspiration no matter which world your human is in.</p><h4>Calishite</h4><p>Shorter and slighter in build than most other humans, Calishites have dusky brown skin, hair, and eyes. They’re found primarily in southwest Faerûn.</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Calishite Names:</span></strong> (Male) Aseir, Bardeid, Haseid, Khemed, Mehmen, Sudeiman, Zasheir; (female) Atala, Ceidil, Hama, Jasmal, Meilil, Seipora, Yasheira, Zasheida; (surnames) Basha, Dumein, Jassan, Khalid, Mostana, Pashar, Rein</p><h4>Chondathan</h4><p>Chondathans are slender, tawny-skinned folk with brown hair that ranges from almost blond to almost black. Most are tall and have green or brown eyes, but these traits are hardly universal. Humans of Chondathan descent dominate the central lands of Faerûn, around the Inner Sea.</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Chondathan Names:</span></strong> (Male) Darvin, Dorn, Evendur, Gorstag, Grim, Helm, Malark, Morn, Randal, Stedd; (female) Arveene, Esvele, Jhessail, Kerri, Lureene, Miri, Rowan, Shandri, Tessele; (surnames) Amblecrown, Buckman, Dundragon, Evenwood, Greycastle, Tallstag</p><h4>Damaran</h4><p>Found primarily in the northwest of Faerûn, Damarans are of moderate height and build, with skin hues ranging from tawny to fair.

They don’t exist in every world of D&amp;D, and even where they are found, they are less widespread than dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans.</p>\n<p>In the cosmopolitan cities of the D&amp;D multiverse, most people hardly look twice at members of even the most exotic races. But the small towns and villages that dot the countryside are different. The common folk aren’t accustomed to seeing members of these races, and they react accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dragonborn.</em></strong> It’s easy to assume that a dragonborn is a monster, especially if his or her scales betray a chromatic heritage. Unless the dragonborn starts breathing fire and causing destruction, though, people are likely to respond with caution rather than outright fear.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Gnome.</em></strong> Gnomes don’t look like a threat and can quickly disarm suspicion with good humor. The common folk are often curious about gnomes, likely never having seen one before, but they are rarely hostile or fearful.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Half-Elf.</em></strong> Although many people have never seen a half-elf, virtually everyone knows they exist. A half-elf stranger’s arrival is followed by gossip behind the half-elf’s back and stolen glances across the common room, rather than any confrontation or open curiosity.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Half-Orc.</em></strong> It’s usually safe to assume that a half-orc is belligerent and quick to anger, so people watch themselves around an unfamiliar half-orc. Shopkeepers might surreptitiously hide valuable or fragile goods when a half-orc comes in, and people slowly clear out of a tavern, assuming a fight will break out soon.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tiefling.</em></strong> Half-orcs are greeted with a practical caution, but tieflings are the subject of supernatural fear. The evil of their heritage is plainly visible in their features, and as far as most people are concerned, a tiefling could very well be a devil straight from the Nine Hells. People might make warding signs as a tiefling approaches, cross the street to avoid passing near, or bar shop doors before a tiefling can enter.</p>\n</blockquote><h2>Dragonborn</h2><p><img class=\"compendium-header-banner-img\" src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/636/dragonbornintro.png\" alt=\"\"></p><p><img src=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/633/dragonborn.png\"></p><blockquote>\n<p>Her father stood on the first of the three stairs that led down from the portal, unmoving. The scales of his face had grown paler around the edges, but Clanless Mehen still looked as if he could wrestle down a dire bear himself. His familiar well-worn armor was gone, replaced by violet-tinted scale armor with bright silvery tracings. There was a blazon on his arm as well, the mark of some foreign house. The sword at his back was the same, though, the one he had carried since even before he had found the twins left in swaddling at the gates of Arush Vayem.</p>\n<p>For all her life, Farideh had known that reading her father’s face was a skill she’d been fortunate to learn. A human who couldn’t spot the shift of her eyes or Havilar’s would certainly see only the indifference of a dragon in Clanless Mehen’s face. But the shift of scales, the arch of a ridge, the set of his eyes, the gape of his teeth — her father’s face spoke volumes.</p>\n<p>But every scale of it, this time, seemed completely still — the indifference of a dragon, even to Farideh.</p>\n<p>— <em>Erin M. Evans,</em><em> The Adversary</em></p>\n</blockquote><p>Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.</p><h3>Proud Dragon Kin</h3><p><img src=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/635/dragonborn2.png\"></p><p>Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6½ feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.</p><p>The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some dragonborn clans. These dragonborn often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon ancestor — bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.</p><h3>Self-Sufficient Clans</h3><p><img src=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/634/dragonborn1.png\"></p><p>To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn’s conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.</p><p>A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn.</p><p>Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they recognize that help is sometimes needed in difficult situations. But the best source for such help is the clan, and when a clan needs help, it turns to another dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races — or even from the gods.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>DRACONIANS</strong></p>\n<p>In the Dragonlance setting, the followers of the evil goddess Takhisis learned a dark ritual that let them corrupt the eggs of metallic dragons, producing evil dragonborn called draconians. Five types of draconians, corresponding to the five types of metallic dragons, fought for Takhisis in the War of the Lance: auraks (gold), baaz (brass), bozak (bronze), kapak (copper), and sivak (silver). In place of their draconic breath weapons, they have unique magical abilities.</p>\n</blockquote><h3>Dragonborn Names</h3><p>Dragonborn have personal names given at birth, but they put their clan names first as a mark of honor. A childhood name or nickname is often used among clutchmates as a descriptive term or a term of endearment.

Like most habitations in Oeble, that particular tenement had been built for humans, and smaller residents coped with the resulting awkwardness as best they could.</p>\n<p>But at least the relative largeness of the apartment gave Burgell room to pack in all his gnome-sized gear. The front room was his workshop, and it contained a bewildering miscellany of tools: hammers, chisels, saws, lockpicks, tinted lenses, jeweler’s loupes, and jars of powdered and shredded ingredients for casting spells. A fat gray cat, the mage’s familiar, lay curled atop a grimoire. It opened its eyes, gave Aeron a disdainful yellow stare, then appeared to go back to sleep.</p>\n<p>— <em>Richard Lee Byers,</em><em> The Black Bouquet</em></p>\n</blockquote><p>A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.</p><h3>Vibrant Expression</h3><p>A gnome’s energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome’s insatiable interest in everything around.</p><p>A gnome’s personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome’s beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome’s clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels.</p><h3>Delighted Dedication</h3><p><img src=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/638/gnome1.png\"></p><p>As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life. Humans might wonder about getting bored over the course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time to savor the beauties of the world in their long years, but gnomes seem to worry that even with all that time, they can’t get in enough of the things they want to do and see.</p><p>Gnomes speak as if they can’t get the thoughts out of their heads fast enough. Even as they offer ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, they still manage to listen carefully to others, adding the appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation along the way.</p><p>Though gnomes love jokes of all kinds, particularly puns and pranks, they’re just as dedicated to the more serious tasks they undertake. Many gnomes are skilled engineers, alchemists, tinkers, and inventors. They’re willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves in the process of perfecting what they do, taking bold (sometimes foolhardy) risks and dreaming large.</p><h3>Bright Burrows</h3><p>Gnomes make their homes in hilly, wooded lands. They live underground but get more fresh air than dwarves do, enjoying the natural, living world on the surface whenever they can. Their homes are well hidden by both clever construction and simple illusions. Welcome visitors are quickly ushered into the bright, warm burrows. Those who are not welcome are unlikely to find the burrows in the first place.</p><p>Gnomes who settle in human lands are commonly gemcutters, engineers, sages, or tinkers. Some human families retain gnome tutors, ensuring that their pupils enjoy a mix of serious learning and delighted enjoyment. A gnome might tutor several generations of a single human family over the course of his or her long life.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>ALWAYS APPRECIATIVE</strong></p>\n<p>It’s rare for a gnome to be hostile or malicious unless he or she has suffered a grievous injury. Gnomes know that most races don’t share their sense of humor, but they enjoy anyone’s company just as they enjoy everything else they set out to do.</p>\n</blockquote><h3>Gnome Names</h3><p>Gnomes love names, and most have half a dozen or so. A gnome’s mother, father, clan elder, aunts, and uncles each give the gnome a name, and various nicknames from just about everyone else might or might not stick over time. Gnome names are typically variants on the names of ancestors or distant relatives, though some are purely new inventions. When dealing with humans and others who are “stuffy” about names, a gnome learns to use no more than three names: a personal name, a clan name, and a nickname, choosing the one in each category that’s the most fun to say.</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Male Names:</span></strong> Alston, Alvyn, Boddynock, Brocc, Burgell, Dimble, Eldon, Erky, Fonkin, Frug, Gerbo, Gimble, Glim, Jebeddo, Kellen, Namfoodle, Orryn, Roondar, Seebo, Sindri, Warryn, Wrenn, Zook</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Female Names:</span></strong> Bimpnottin, Breena, Caramip, Carlin, Donella, Duvamil, Ella, Ellyjobell, Ellywick, Lilli, Loopmottin, Lorilla, Mardnab, Nissa, Nyx, Oda, Orla, Roywyn, Shamil, Tana, Waywocket, Zanna</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Clan Names: </span></strong>Beren, Daergel, Folkor, Garrick, Nackle, Murnig, Ningel, Raulnor, Scheppen, Timbers, Turen</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Nicknames: </span></strong>Aleslosh, Ashhearth, Badger, Cloak, Doublelock, Filchbatter, Fnipper, Ku, Nim, Oneshoe, Pock, Sparklegem, Stumbleduck</p><h3>Seeing the World</h3><p>Curious and impulsive, gnomes might take up adventuring as a way to see the world or for the love of exploring. As lovers of gems and other fine items, some gnomes take to adventuring as a quick, if dangerous, path to wealth. Regardless of what spurs them to adventure, gnomes who adopt this way of life eke as much enjoyment out of it as they do out of any other activity they undertake, sometimes to the great annoyance of their adventuring companions.</p><h3>Gnome Traits</h3><p>Your gnome character has certain characteristics in common with all other gnomes.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Ability Score Increase.</span> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Age.</span> Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected to settle down into an adult life by around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500 years.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Alignment.</span> Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or inventors. Those who tend toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters, wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are good-hearted, and even the tricksters among them are more playful than vicious.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Size.</span> Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and average about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Speed.</span> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Darkvision.</span> Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Gnome Cunning.</span> You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Languages.</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. The Gnomish language, which uses the Dwarvish script, is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Subrace.</span> Two subraces of gnomes are found among the worlds of D&amp;D: forest gnomes and rock gnomes. Choose one of these subraces.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>DEEP GNOMES</strong></p>\n<p>A third subrace of gnomes, the deep gnomes (or svirfneblin), live in small communities scattered in the Underdark. Unlike the duergar and the drow, svirfneblin are as good as their surface cousins. However, their humor and enthusiasm are dampened by their oppressive environment, and their inventive expertise is directed mostly toward stonework.</p>\n</blockquote><h3>Forest Gnome</h3><p>As a forest gnome, you have a natural knack for illusion and inherent quickness and stealth. In the worlds of D&amp;D, forest gnomes are rare and secretive. They gather in hidden communities in sylvan forests, using illusions and trickery to conceal themselves from threats or to mask their escape should they be detected. Forest gnomes tend to be friendly with other good-spirited woodland folk, and they regard elves and good fey as their most important allies. These gnomes also befriend small forest animals and rely on them for information about threats that might prowl their lands.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Ability Score Increase. </span>Your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Natural Illusionist. </span>You know the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/minor-illusion\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"minor illusion\">minor illusion</a> cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Speak with Small Beasts. </span>Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas with Small or smaller beasts. Forest gnomes love animals and often keep squirrels, badgers, rabbits, moles, woodpeckers, and other creatures as beloved pets.</p><h3>Rock Gnome</h3><p>As a rock gnome, you have a natural inventiveness and hardiness beyond that of other gnomes. Most gnomes in the worlds of D&amp;D are rock gnomes, including the tinker gnomes of the Dragonlance setting.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Ability Score Increase.</span> Your Constitution score increases by 1.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Artificer’s Lore.</span> Whenever you make an Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#History\">History</a>) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you normally apply.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Tinker.</span> You have proficiency with artisan’s tools (tinker’s tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time.</p><p>When you create a device, choose one of the following options:</p><p><em><span class=\"italic\">Clockwork Toy. </span></em>This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction.

He thought he saw the figure of a man striding up the path. Standing, Flint drew back into the shadow of a tall pine to see better. The man’s walk was marked by an easy grace — an elvish grace, Flint would have said; yet the man’s body had the thickness and tight muscles of a human, while the facial hair was definitely humankind’s. All the dwarf could see of the man’s face beneath a green hood was tan skin and a brownish-red beard. A longbow was slung over one shoulder and a sword hung at his left side. He was dressed in soft leather, carefully tooled in the intricate designs the elves loved. But no elf in the world of Krynn could grow a beard . . . no elf, but . . .</p>\n<p>“Tanis?” said Flint hesitantly as the man neared.</p>\n<p>“The same.” The newcomer’s bearded face split in a wide grin. He held open his arms and, before the dwarf could stop him, engulfed Flint in a hug that lifted him off the ground. The dwarf clasped his old friend close for a brief instant, then, remembering his dignity, squirmed and freed himself from the half-elf’s embrace.</p>\n<p>—&nbsp;<em>Margaret Weis and Tr</em><em>acy Hickman, Dragons of Autumn Twilight</em></p>\n</blockquote><p>Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.</p><h3>Of Two Worlds</h3><p>To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they look human. In height, they’re on par with both parents, though they’re neither as slender as elves nor as broad as humans. They range from under 5 feet to about 6 feet tall, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly taller and heavier than women. Half-elf men do have facial hair, and sometimes grow beards to mask their elven ancestry. Half-elven coloration and features lie somewhere between their human and elf parents, and thus show a variety even more pronounced than that found among either race. They tend to have the eyes of their elven parents.</p><h3>Diplomats or Wanderers</h3><p><img src=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/641/half-elf1.png\"></p><p>Half-elves have no lands of their own, though they are welcome in human cities and somewhat less welcome in elven forests. In large cities in regions where elves and humans interact often, half-elves are sometimes numerous enough to form small communities of their own. They enjoy the company of other half-elves, the only people who truly understand what it is to live between these two worlds.</p><p>In most parts of the world, though, half-elves are uncommon enough that one might live for years without meeting another. Some half-elves prefer to avoid company altogether, wandering the wilds as trappers, foresters, hunters, or adventurers and visiting civilization only rarely. Like elves, they are driven by the wanderlust that comes of their longevity. Others, in contrast, throw themselves into the thick of society, putting their charisma and social skills to great use in diplomatic roles or as swindlers.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>EXCELLENT AMBASSADORS</strong></p>\n<p>Many half-elves learn at an early age to get along with everyone, defusing hostility and finding common ground. As a race, they have elven grace without elven aloofness and human energy without human boorishness. They often make excellent ambassadors and go-betweens (except between elves and humans, since each side suspects the half-elf of favoring the other).</p>\n</blockquote><h3>Half-Elf Names</h3><p>Half-elves use either human or elven naming conventions. As if to emphasize that they don’t really fit in to either society, half-elves raised among humans are often given elven names, and those raised among elves often take human names.</p><h3>Half-Elf Traits</h3><p>Your half-elf character has some qualities in common with elves and some that are unique to half-elves.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Ability Score Increase.</span> Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Age. </span>Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Alignment. </span>Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage. They value both personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others’ demands, and sometimes prove unreliable, or at least unpredictable.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Size. </span>Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall.

He usually rose before most of his warriors, since he had a strong streak of human blood in him, and he found the daylight less bothersome than most of his tribe did. Among the Bloody Skulls, a warrior was judged by his strength, his fierceness, and his wits. Human ancestry was no blemish against a warrior — provided he was every bit as strong, enduring, and bloodthirsty as his full-blooded kin. Half-orcs who were weaker than their orc comrades didn’t last long among the Bloody Skulls or any other orc tribe for that matter. But it was often true that a bit of human blood gave a warrior just the right mix of cunning, ambition, and self-discipline to go far indeed, as Mhurren had. He was master of a tribe that could muster two thousand spears, and the strongest chief in Thar.</p>\n<p>— <em>Richard Bak</em><em>er, Swordmage</em></p>\n</blockquote><p>Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock or having fought to a standstill after years of conflict, orc and human tribes sometimes form alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to the terror of civilized lands nearby. When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and savage fury.</p><h3>Scarred and Strong</h3><p>Half-orcs’ grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and towering builds make their orcish heritage plain for all to see. Half-orcs stand between 5 and 7 feet tall and usually weigh between 180 and 250 pounds.</p><p>Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of pride and ornamental scars as things of beauty. Other scars, though, mark an orc or half-orc as a former slave or a disgraced exile. Any half-orc who has lived among or near orcs has scars, whether they are marks of humiliation or of pride, recounting their past exploits and injuries. Such a half-orc living among humans might display these scars proudly or hide them in shame.</p><h3>The Mark of Gruumsh</h3><p><img src=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/644/half-orc1.png\"></p><p>The one-eyed god Gruumsh created the orcs, and even those orcs who turn away from his worship can’t fully escape his influence. The same is true of half-orcs, though their human blood moderates the impact of their orcish heritage. Some half-orcs hear the whispers of Gruumsh in their dreams, calling them to unleash the rage that simmers within them. Others feel Gruumsh’s exultation when they join in melee combat — and either exult along with him or shiver with fear and loathing. Half-orcs are not evil by nature, but evil does lurk within them, whether they embrace it or rebel against it.</p><p>Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-orcs feel emotion powerfully. Rage doesn’t just quicken their pulse, it makes their bodies burn. An insult stings like acid, and sadness saps their strength. But they laugh loudly and heartily, and simple bodily pleasures — feasting, drinking, wrestling, drumming, and wild dancing — fill their hearts with joy. They tend to be short-tempered and sometimes sullen, more inclined to action than contemplation and to fighting than arguing. The most accomplished half-orcs are those with enough self-control to get by in a civilized land.</p><h3>Tribes and Slums</h3><p>Half-orcs most often live among orcs. Of the other races, humans are most likely to accept half-orcs, and half-orcs almost always live in human lands when not living among orc tribes. Whether proving themselves among rough barbarian tribes or scrabbling to survive in the slums of larger cities, half-orcs get by on their physical might, their endurance, and the sheer determination they inherit from their human ancestry.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>GRUDGING ACCEPTANCE</strong></p>\n<p>Each half-orc finds a way to gain acceptance from those who hate orcs. Some are reserved, trying not to draw attention to themselves. A few demonstrate piety and good-heartedness as publicly as they can (whether or not such demonstrations are genuine). And some simply try to be so tough that others just avoid them.</p>\n</blockquote><h3>Half-Orc Names</h3><p>Half-orcs usually have names appropriate to the culture in which they were raised. A half-orc who wants to fit in among humans might trade an orc name for a human name. Some half-orcs with human names decide to adopt a guttural orc name because they think it makes them more intimidating.</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Male Orc Names: </span></strong>Dench, Feng, Gell, Henk, Holg, Imsh, Keth, Krusk, Mhurren, Ront, Shump, Thokk</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Female Orc Names: </span></strong>Baggi, Emen, Engong, Kansif, Myev, Neega, Ovak, Ownka, Shautha, Sutha, Vola, Volen, Yevelda</p><h3>Half-Orc Traits</h3><p>Your half-orc character has certain traits deriving from your orc ancestry.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Ability Score Increase.</span> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Age. </span>Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Alignment. </span>Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their orc parents and are not strongly inclined toward good. Half-orcs raised among orcs and willing to live out their lives among them are usually evil.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Size. </span>Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Speed. </span>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Darkvision. </span>Thanks to your orc blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

That is the burden of every tiefling. Some break under it, some make it the millstone around their neck, some revel in it.” He tilted his head again, scrutinizing her, with that wicked glint in his eyes. “You fight it, don’t you? Like a little wildcat, I wager. Every little jab and comment just sharpens your claws.”</p>\n<p>— <em>Erin M. Evans,</em><em> Brimstone Angels</em></p>\n</blockquote><p>To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus — overlord of the Nine Hells — into their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children’s children will always be held accountable.</p><h3>Infernal Bloodline</h3><p><img src=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/647/tiefling1.png\"></p><p>Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the broadest possible sense, they still look human. However, their infernal heritage has left a clear imprint on their appearance. Tieflings have large horns that take any of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like a ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle’s, and some spiral upward like an antelopes’ horns. They have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid colors — black, red, white, silver, or gold — with no visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range of human coloration, but also include various shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from behind their horns, is usually dark, from black or brown to dark red, blue, or purple.</p><h3>Self-Reliant and Suspicious</h3><p>Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more respect.</p><p>Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a tiefling’s companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them. And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend or ally for life.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>MUTUAL MISTRUST</strong></p>\n<p>People tend to be suspicious of tieflings, assuming that their infernal heritage has left its mark on their personality and morality, not just their appearance. Shopkeepers keep a close eye on their goods when tieflings enter their stores, the town watch might follow a tiefling around for a while, and demagogues blame tieflings for strange happenings. The reality, though, is that a tiefling’s bloodline doesn’t affect his or her personality to any great degree. Years of dealing with mistrust does leave its mark on most tieflings, and they respond to it in different ways. Some choose to live up to the wicked stereotype, but others are virtuous. Most are simply very aware of how people respond to them. After dealing with this mistrust throughout youth, a tiefling often develops the ability to overcome prejudice through charm or intimidation.</p>\n</blockquote><h3>Tiefling Names</h3><p>Tiefling names fall into three broad categories. Tieflings born into another culture typically have names reflective of that culture. Some have names derived from the Infernal language, passed down through generations, that reflect their fiendish heritage. And some younger tieflings, striving to find a place in the world, adopt a name that signifies a virtue or other concept and then try to embody that concept. For some, the chosen name is a noble quest. For others, it’s a grim destiny.</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Male Infernal Names: </span></strong>Akmenos, Amnon, Barakas, Damakos, Ekemon, Iados, Kairon, Leucis, Melech, Mordai, Morthos, Pelaios, Skamos, Therai</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Female Infernal Names: </span></strong>Akta, Anakis, Bryseis, Criella, Damaia, Ea, Kallista, Lerissa, Makaria, Nemeia, Orianna, Phelaia, Rieta</p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">“Virtue” Names: </span></strong>Art, Carrion, Chant, Creed, Despair, Excellence, Fear, Glory, Hope, Ideal, Music, Nowhere, Open, Poetry, Quest, Random, Reverence, Sorrow, Temerity, Torment, Weary</p><h3>Tiefling Traits</h3><p>Tieflings share certain racial traits as a result of their infernal descent.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Ability Score Increase. </span>Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Age.</span> Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Alignment.</span> Tieflings might not have an innate tendency toward evil, but many of them end up there.

When gods walk the world, clerics channel divine power, evil cults perform dark sacrifices in subterranean lairs, and shining paladins stand like beacons against the darkness, it’s hard to be ambivalent about the deities and deny their existence.</p><p>Many people in the worlds of D&amp;D worship different gods at different times and circumstances. People in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might pray to Sune for luck in love, make an offering to Waukeen before heading to the market, and pray to appease Talos when a severe storm blows in—all in the same day. Many people have a favorite among the gods, one whose ideals and teachings they make their own. And a few people dedicate themselves entirely to a single god, usually serving as a priest or champion of that god’s ideals.</p><p>Your DM determines which gods, if any, are worshiped in his or her campaign. From among the gods available, you can choose a single deity for your character to serve, worship, or pay lip service to. Or you can pick a few that your character prays to most often. Or just make a mental note of the gods who are revered in your DM’s campaign so you can invoke their names when appropriate. If you’re playing a cleric or a character with the Acolyte background, decide which god your deity serves or served, and consider the deity’s suggested domains when selecting your character’s domain.</p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/738/appdeitysymbols.png\"></p><h2>D&amp;D Pantheons</h2><p>Each world in the D&amp;D multiverse has its own pantheons of deities, ranging in size from the teeming pantheons of the Forgotten Realms and Greyhawk to the more focused religions of Eberron and Dragonlance. Many of the nonhuman races worship the same gods on different worlds—Moradin, for example, is revered by dwarves of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, and many other worlds.</p><h3>The Forgotten Realms</h3><p>Dozens of deities are revered, worshiped, and feared throughout the world of the Forgotten Realms. At least thirty deities are widely known across the Realms, and many more are worshiped locally, by individual tribes, small cults, or certain sects of larger religious temples.</p><h3>Greyhawk</h3><p>The gods of Greyhawk come from at least four different pantheons, representing the faiths of the various ethnic groups that populated the continent of Oerik over the ages. As a result, there’s a great deal of overlap in their portfolios: Pelor is the Flan god of the sun and Pholtus is the Oeridian sun god, for example.</p><h3>Dragonlance</h3><p>The gods of the world of Krynn are three families: seven gods of good headed by Paladine and Mishakal, seven of neutrality headed by Gilean, and seven of evil headed by Takhisis and Sargonnas. These deities have been called by many different names and held in varying levels of esteem by different peoples and cultures through the world’s history, but they are the only gods of this world—their place fixed in the stars as constellations.</p><h3>Eberron</h3><p>The world of Eberron has many different religions, but the most important revolves around a pantheon called the Sovereign Host and their malign shadow, the Dark Six. The gods of the Sovereign Host are thought to have dominion over every aspect of existence, and to speak with a unified voice. But the Dark Six are the primitive, bloody, and cruel gods who offer a dissenting voice.</p><p>Eberron’s other religions are very different from the traditional D&amp;D pantheons. The monotheistic Church of the Silver Flame is devoted to fighting against evil in the world, but plagued by corruption in its own ranks. The philosophy of the Blood of Vol teaches that divinity lies within all mortal beings and reveres the undead who have secured that immortality. Various mad cults are devoted to the demons and horrors imprisoned in Eberron’s Underdark (called Khyber, the Dragon Below). The followers of the Path of Light believe that the world is heading toward a glorious future where the shadows that cloud this world will be transformed into light. And two related nations of elves revere their ancestral spirits: the Undying Court, preserved as spirits or even undead forms, and the glorified Spirits of the Past, the great heroes of ancient wars.</p><h3>Nonhuman Deities</h3><p>Certain gods closely associated with nonhuman races are revered on many different worlds, though not always in the same way. The nonhuman races of the Forgotten Realms and Greyhawk share these deities.</p><p>Nonhuman races often have whole pantheons of their own. Besides Moradin, for example, the dwarf gods include Moradin’s wife, Berronar Truesilver, and a number of other gods thought to be their children and grandchildren: Abbathor, Clangeddin Silverbeard, Dugmaren Brightmantle, Dumathoin, Gorm Gulthyn, Haela Brightaxe, Marthammor Duin, Sharindlar, Thard Harr, and Vergadain. Individual clans and kingdoms of dwarves might revere some, all, or none of these deities, and some have other gods unknown (or known by other names) to outsiders.</p><blockquote>\n<p id=\"life-and-death-domains\"><strong>THE LIFE AND DEATH DOMAINS</strong></p>\n<p>Many deities in this section suggest the Life domain, particularly if they are closely associated with healing, protection, childbirth, nurturing, or fertility. As described in the <a title=\"Classes (Cleric)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/classes#Cleric\">chapter 3</a>, though, the Life domain is incredibly broad, and a cleric of any non-evil deity can choose it.</p>\n<p>A number of other deities, mostly evil ones, suggest the Death domain, which is detailed in the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>. Most clerics who choose this domain are evil NPCs, but if you want to worship a god of death, consult your Dungeon Master.</p>\n</blockquote><h4>Deities of the Forgotten

class=\"compendium-hr\">Fantasy-Historical Pantheons</h2>\n<p>The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fantasy interpretations of historical religions from our world’s ancient times. They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a D&amp;D game, divorced from their historical context in the real world and united into pantheons that serve the needs of the game.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TheCelticPantheon\" class=\"compendium-hr\">The Celtic Pantheon</h3>\n<p>It’s said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak—and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from the brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.</p>\n<p>The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TheGreekPantheon\" class=\"compendium-hr\">The Greek Pantheon</h3>\n<p>The gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the cloud-enshrouded peaks. The thick boar-infested woods and the sere, olive-covered hillsides hold evidence of their passing. Every aspect of nature echoes with their presence, and they’ve made a place for themselves inside the human heart, too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TheEgyptianPantheon\" class=\"compendium-hr\">The Egyptian Pantheon</h3>\n<p>These gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos and the maintenance of the divine principle of Ma’at—the fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and women in their logical and rightful place in the universe.</p>\n<p>The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three gods with the Death domain of different alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning. Thus, although most clerics of the Death domain (found in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</span></em>) are villainous characters, clerics who serve Anubis or Nephthys need not be.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TheNorsePantheon\" class=\"compendium-hr\">The Norse Pantheon</h3>\n<p>Where the land plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the beach, where the glaciers flow forward and retreat with every fall and spring—this is the land of the Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It’s a brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven’t been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it’s surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.</p>\n<p>The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym). Like the gods of Greyhawk, gods in different families sometimes have overlap in their spheres of influence: Frey (of the Vanir) and Odur (of the Aesir) <br>are both associated with the sun, for example.</p>\n<h4 id=\"CelticDeities\">Celtic Deities</h4>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"deities-table-name\">Deity</th>\n<th

proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>martial</strong>. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.</p><p>Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.</p><h3>Weapon Properties</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/723/c53.png\"></p><p>Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.</p><p><strong>Ammunition.</strong> You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</p><p>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see \"Improvised Weapons\" later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.</p><p><strong>Finesse.</strong> When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p><p><strong>Heavy.</strong> Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.</p><p><strong>Light.</strong> A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. See the rules for two-weapon fighting in <a title=\"Two-Weapon Fighting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat#TwoWeaponFighting\">chapter 9</a>.</p><p><strong>Loading.</strong> Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p><p><strong>Range.</strong> A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p><p><strong>Reach.</strong> This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it (see <a title=\"Opportunity Attacks\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat#OpportunityAttacks\">chapter 9</a>).</p><p><strong>Special.</strong> A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see \"Special Weapons\" later in this section).</p><p><strong>Thrown.</strong> If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</p><p><strong>Two-Handed.</strong> This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.</p><p><strong>Versatile.</strong> This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property — the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p><h3>Improvised Weapons</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/724/c54.png\"></p><p>Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.</p><p>Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.</p><p>An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p><h3>Silvered Weapons</h3><p>Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.</p><h3>Special Weapons</h3><p>Weapons with special rules are described here.</p><p><strong>Lance.</strong> You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.</p><p><strong>Net.</strong> A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained\">restrained</a> until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.</p><p>When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/725/c55.png\"></p></div>","img":null,"_id":"nDuyxbnoQx00qqZA"}

All of us tend to get ample helpings of fantasy when we are very young, from fairy tales such as those written by the Brothers Grimm and Andrew Lang. This often leads to reading books of mythology, paging through bestiaries, and consultation of compilations of the myths of various lands and peoples. Upon such a base I built my interest in fantasy, being an avid reader of all science fiction and fantasy literature since 1950.

They are heroes, compelled to explore the dark places of the world and take on the challenges that lesser women and men can’t stand against.</p><p>Class is the primary definition of what your character can do. It’s more than a profession; it’s your character’s calling. Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the multiverse. A fighter, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might see himself as a willing servant in a god’s unfolding plan or a conflict brewing among various deities. While the fighter has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the cleric might know a number of priests, paladins, and devotees who share his faith.</p><p>Your class gives you a variety of special features, such as a fighter’s mastery of weapons and armor, and a wizard’s spells. At low levels, your class gives you only two or three features, but as you advance in level you gain more and your existing features often improve. Each class entry in this chapter&nbsp;includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, and a detailed explanation of each one.</p><p>Adventurers sometimes advance in more than one class. A rogue might switch direction in life and swear the oath of a paladin. A barbarian might discover latent magical ability and dabble in the sorcerer class while continuing to advance as a barbarian. Elves are known to combine martial mastery with magical training and advance as fighters and wizards simultaneously. Optional rules for combining classes in this way, called multiclassing, appear in <a title=\"Customization Options\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/customization-options#Multiclassing\">chapter 6</a>.</p><p>Twelve classes — listed in the Classes table — are found in almost every D&amp;D world and define the spectrum of typical adventurers.</p><h2>Classes Summary</h2><div><table class=\"compendium-horizontal-scroll-table compendium-no-left-right-padding-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-20\">\n<th class=\"classes-table-class-name\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Class</span></p>\n</th>\n<th class=\"classes-table-description\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Description</p>\n</th>\n<th class=\"classes-table-hit-die\">\n<p>Hit Die</p>\n</th>\n<th class=\"classes-table-primary-ability\">\n<p>Primary Ability</p>\n</th>\n<th class=\"classes-table-saving-throw-proficiencies\">\n<p>Saving Throw<br>Proficiencies</p>\n</th>\n<th class=\"classes-table-armor-and-weapon-proficiencies\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Armor and Weapon<br>Proficiencies</p>\n</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-27\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p><strong><a title=\"Barbarian\" href=\"#Barbarian\">Barbarian</a></strong></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>A fierce warrior of primitive background who can enter a battle rage</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>d12</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>Strength</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>Strength &amp;

He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his people’s elk herd.</p><p>A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.</p><p>Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.</p><p>These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.</p><p>For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.</p><h3>Primal Instinct</h3><p>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one’s own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature — keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.</p><p>Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p><h3>A Life of Danger</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/680/c3barbarian1.png\"></p><p>Not every member of the tribes deemed “barbarians” by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don’t have to.</p><p>Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.</p><h3>Creating a Barbarian</h3><p>When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?</p><p>What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to “civilized” lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.</p><h4>Quick Build</h4><p>You can make a barbarian quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the outlander background.</p><div><table class=\"compendium-horizontal-scroll-table compendium-no-left-right-padding-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-20\">\n<th

href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival\">Survival</a></p><h4>Equipment</h4><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a greataxe or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) any martial melee weapon</li>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) two handaxes or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) any simple weapon</li>\n<li>An explorer’s pack and four javelins</li>\n</ul><h3>Rage</h3><p>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</p><p>While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:</p><ul>\n<li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>\n<li>When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.</li>\n<li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>\n</ul><p>If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</p><p>Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\">unconscious</a> or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p><p>Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p><h3>Unarmored Defense</h3><p>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p><h3>Reckless Attack</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</p><h3>Danger Sense</h3><p>At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.</p><p>You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded\">blinded</a> , <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Deafened\">deafened</a> , or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a>.</p><h3>Primal Path</h3><p>At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h3>Extra Attack</h3><p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\">Attack</a> action on your turn.</p><h3>Fast Movement</h3><p>Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.</p><h3>Feral Instinct</h3><p>By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.</p><p>Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a>, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.</p><h3>Brutal Critical</h3><p>Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.</p><p>This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.</p><h3>Relentless Rage</h3><p>Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.</p><p>Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</p><h3>Persistent Rage</h3><p>Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\">unconscious</a> or if you choose to end it.</p><h3>Indomitable Might</h3><p>Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.</p><h3>Primal Champion</h3><p>At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.</p><h2>Primal Paths</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/681/c3barbarian2.png\"></p><p>Rage burns in every barbarian’s heart, a furnace that drives him or her toward greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to different sources, however. For some, it is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a totem animal.</p><h3>Path of the Berserker</h3><p>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end — that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.</p><h4>Frenzy</h4><p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a> (as described in <a title=\"Exhaustion\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">appendix A</a>).</p><h4>Mindless Rage</h4><p>Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> while raging. If you are <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.</p><h4>Intimidating Presence</h4><p>Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.</p><p>If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.</p><h4>Retaliation</h4><p>Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.</p><h3>Path of the Totem Warrior</h3><p>The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.</p><p>Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.</p><h4>Spirit Seeker</h4><p>Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/beast-sense\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"beast sense\">beast sense</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/speak-with-animals\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"speak with animals\">speak with animals</a> spells, but only as rituals, as described in chapter 10, “<a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting\">S</a><a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting\">pellcasting</a>.”</p><h4>Totem Spirit</h4><p>At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object — an amulet or similar adornment — that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.</p><p>Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Bear. </span>While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Eagle. </span>While you’re raging, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash\">Dash</a> action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Wolf. </span>While you’re raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.</p><h4>Aspect of the Beast</h4><p>At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Bear.</span> You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Eagle.</span> You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn’t impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) checks.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Wolf.</span> You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace (see chapter 8, “<a title=\"Travel Pace\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring#TravelPace\">Adventuring</a>,” for rules on travel pace).</p><h4>Spirit Walker</h4><p>At 10th level, you can cast the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/commune-with-nature\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"commune with nature\">commune with nature</a> spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.</p><h4>Totemic Attunement</h4><p>At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Bear.</span> While you’re raging, any creature within 5 feet of you that’s hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature.

The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them.</p><p>Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring that her companions’ words will be well received.</p><p>Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.</p><h3>Music and Magic</h3><p>In the worlds of D&amp;D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.</p><p>The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.</p><h3>Learning from Experience</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/682/c3bard2.png\"></p><p>True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard’s life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.</p><p>Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel — to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon — makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.</p><h3>Creating a Bard</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/683/c3bard3.png\"></p><p>Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your character’s background and motivations are not as important as the stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane childhood. There’s no good story to be told about that, so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy of a story. Some bards acquire their magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspiration of fey or other supernatural creatures.</p><p>Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?</p><h4>Quick Build</h4><p>You can make a bard quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the entertainer background. Third, choose the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dancing-lights\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dancing lights\">dancing lights</a> and <a

three</p><h4>Equipment</h4><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a rapier, (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) a longsword, or (<span class=\"italic\">c</span>) any simple weapon</li>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a diplomat’s pack or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) an entertainer’s pack</li>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a lute or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) any other musical instrument</li>\n<li>Leather armor and a dagger</li>\n</ul><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. See <a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting\">chapter 10</a> for the general rules of spellcasting and <a title=\"Spells\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spells\">chapter 11</a> for the bard spell list.</p><h4>Cantrips</h4><p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</p><h4>Spell Slots</h4><p>The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span class=\"italic\">cure wounds</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"cure wounds\">cure wounds</a> using either slot.</p><h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4><p>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><h4>Ritual Casting</h4><p>You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p><h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4><p>You can use a musical instrument (see chapter 5, “<a title=\"Musical Instruments\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#MusicalInstruments\">Equip­ment</a>”) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</p><h3>Bardic Inspiration</h3><p>You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</p><p>Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><p>Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</p><h3>Jack of All Trades</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.</p><h3>Song of Rest</h3><p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</p><p>The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</p><h3>Bard College</h3><p>At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.</p><h3>Expertise</h3><p>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p><p>At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.</p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h3>Font of Inspiration</h3><p>Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Countercharm</h3><p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a>. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a> or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).</p><h3>Magical Secrets</h3><p>By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any classes, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.</p><p>The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.</p><p>You learn two additional spells from any classes at 14th level and again at 18th level.</p><h3>Superior Inspiration</h3><p>At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.</p><h2>Bard Colleges</h2><p>The way of a bard is gregarious. Bards seek each other out to swap songs and stories, boast of their accomplishments, and share their knowledge. Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions.</p><h3>College of Lore</h3><p>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</p><p>The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.</p><p>The college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</p><h4>Bonus Proficiencies</h4><p>When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.</p><h4>Cutting Words</h4><p>Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can’t hear you or if it’s immune to being <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a>.</p><h4>Additional Magical Secrets</h4><p>At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don’t count against the number of bard spells you know.</p><h4>Peerless Skill</h4><p>Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you whether you succeed or fail.</p><h3>College of Valor</h3><p>Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn’t pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.</p><h4>Bonus Proficiencies</h4><p>When you join the College of Valor at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.</p><h4>Combat Inspiration</h4><p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.</p><h4>Extra Attack</h4><p>Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\">Attack</a> action on your turn.</p><h4>Battle Magic</h4><p>At 14th level, you have mastered the art of weaving spellcasting and weapon use into a single harmonious act. When you use your action to cast a bard spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p><h2>Cleric</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/687/c3clericintro.png\"></p><p>Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that spills out to heal his battle-worn companions.</p><p>Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with every foe’s fall.</p><p>Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.</p><p>Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.</p><h3>Healers and Warriors</h3><p>Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don’t grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.</p><p>Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity’s wishes.</p><p>Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.</p><h3>Divine Agents</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/685/c3cleric1.png\"></p><p>Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods’ will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.</p><p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities’ worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.</p><p>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric’s aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.</p><h3>Creating a Cleric</h3><p>As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve and what principles you want your character to embody. <a title=\"Gods of the Multiverse\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/appendix-b-gods-of-the-multiverse#GodsoftheMultiverse\">Appendix B</a> includes lists of many of the gods of the multiverse. Check with your DM to learn which deities are in your campaign.</p><p>Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider your cleric’s relationship to that god. Did you enter this service willingly? Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service with no regard for your wishes? How do the temple priests of your faith regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker? What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity have a special task in mind for you? Or are you striving to prove yourself worthy of a great quest?</p><h4>Quick Build</h4><p>You can make a cleric quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Strength or Constitution. Second, choose the acolyte background.</p><div><table class=\"compendium-horizontal-scroll-table compendium-no-left-right-padding-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-3\">\n<th

href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Religion\">Religion</a></p><h4>Equipment</h4><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a mace or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) a warhammer (if proficient)</li>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) scale mail, (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) leather armor, or (<span class=\"italic\">c</span>) chain mail (if proficient)</li>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or

symbol</li>\n</ul><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See <a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting\">chapter 10</a> for the general rules of spellcasting and <a title=\"Spells\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spells\">chapter 11</a> for the cleric&nbsp;spell list.</p><h4>Cantrips</h4><p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p><h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4><p>The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"italic\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4><p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><h4>Ritual Casting</h4><p>You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p><h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4><p>You can use a holy symbol (see chapter 5, “<a title=\"Holy Symbol\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#HolySymbol\">Equipment</a>”) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p><h3>Divine Domain</h3><p>Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p><h4>Domain Spells</h4><p>Each domain has a list of spells — its domain spells — that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p><p>If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p><h3>Channel Divinity</h3><p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p><p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p><p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p><p>Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p><h4>Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h4><p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p><p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash\">Dash</a> action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dodge\">Dodge</a> action.</p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h3>Destroy Undead</h3><p>Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.</p><p><strong>Destroy Undead</strong></p><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Cleric Level</th>\n<th>Destroys Undead of CR . . .</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>1/2 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>1 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>2 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>3 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>4 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h3>Divine Intervention</h3><p>Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.</p><p>Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.</p><p>If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.</p><p>At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p><h2>Divine Domains</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/686/c3cleric2.png\"></p><p>In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity’s domain. All the domains over which a deity has influence are called the deity’s portfolio. For example, the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of Knowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you choose one aspect of your deity’s portfolio to emphasize, and you are granted powers related to that domain.</p><p>Your choice might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be worshiped in one region as Phoebus (“radiant”) Apollo, emphasizing his influence over the Light domain, and in a different place as Apollo Acesius (“healing”), emphasizing his association with the Life domain. Alternatively, your choice of domain could simply be a matter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals to you most.</p><p>Each domain’s description gives examples of deities who have influence over that domain. Gods are included from the worlds of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Eberron campaign settings, as well as from the Celtic, Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons of antiquity.</p><h3>Knowledge Domain</h3><p>The gods of knowledge — including Oghma, Boccob, Gilean, Aureon, and Thoth — value learning and understanding above all. Some teach that knowledge is to be gathered and shared in libraries and universities, or promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention. Some deities hoard knowledge and keep its secrets to themselves. And some promise their followers that they will gain tremendous power if they unlock the secrets of the multiverse. Followers of these gods study esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret places of the earth, and learn all they can. Some gods of knowledge promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention, including smith deities like Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.</p><h4>Knowledge Domain Spells</h4><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\">Cleric Level</th>\n<th>Spells</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p>1st</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/command\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"command\">command</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"identify\">identify</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>3rd</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/augury\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"augury\">augury</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/suggestion\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"suggestion\">suggestion</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>5th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/nondetection\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"nondetection\">nondetection</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/speak-with-dead\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"speak with dead\">speak with dead</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>7th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/arcane-eye\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"arcane eye\">arcane eye</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/confusion\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"confusion\">confusion</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>9th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/legend-lore\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"legend lore\">legend lore</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scrying\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"scrying\">scrying</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h4>Blessings of Knowledge</h4><p>At 1st level, you learn two languages of your choice.

As an action, you choose one skill or tool. For 10 minutes, you have proficiency with the chosen skill or tool.</p><h4>Channel Divinity: Read Thoughts</h4><p>At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to read a creature’s thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature’s mind to command it.</p><p>As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can’t use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute.</p><p>During that time, you can use your action to end this effect and cast the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/suggestion\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"suggestion\">suggestion</a> spell on the creature without expending a spell slot. The target automatically fails its saving throw against the spell.</p><h4>Potent Spellcasting</h4><p>Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.</p><h4>Visions of the Past</h4><p>Starting at 17th level, you can call up visions of the past that relate to an object you hold or your immediate surroundings. You spend at least 1 minute in meditation and prayer, then receive dreamlike, shadowy glimpses of recent events. You can meditate in this way for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom score and must maintain concentration during that time, as if you were casting a spell.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Object Reading. </span>Holding an object as you meditate, you can see visions of the object’s previous owner. After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent significant event involving the object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Area Reading. </span>As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.</p><h3>Life Domain</h3><p>The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy — one of the fundamental forces of the universe — that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).</p><h4>Life Domain Spells</h4><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\">Cleric Level</th>\n<th>Spells</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p>1st</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/bless\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"bless\">bless</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"cure wounds\">cure wounds</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>3rd</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lesser-restoration\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"lesser restoration\">lesser restoration</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/spiritual-weapon\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"spiritual weapon\">spiritual weapon</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>5th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/beacon-of-hope\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"beacon of hope\">beacon of hope</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/revivify\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"revivify\">revivify</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>7th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/death-ward\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"death ward\">death ward</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/guardian-of-faith\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"guardian of faith\">guardian of faith</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>9th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mass-cure-wounds\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"mass cure wounds\">mass cure wounds</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/raise-dead\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"raise dead\">raise dead</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h4>Bonus Proficiency</h4><p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.</p><h4>Disciple of Life</h4><p>Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.</p><h4>Channel Divinity: Preserve Life</h4><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.</p><p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct.</p><h4>Blessed Healer</h4><p>Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.</p><h4>Divine Strike</h4><p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p><h4>Supreme Healing</h4><p>Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.</p><h3>Light Domain</h3><p>Gods of light — including Helm, Lathander, Pholtus, Branchala, the Silver Flame, Belenus, Apollo, and Re-Horakhty — promote the ideals of rebirth and renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty, often using the symbol of the sun. Some of these gods are portrayed as the sun itself or as a charioteer who guides the sun across the sky. Others are tireless sentinels whose eyes pierce every shadow and see through every deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry, who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul’s improvement. Clerics of a god of light are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their gods’ discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.</p><h4>Light Domain Spells</h4><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\">Cleric Level</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Spells</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p>1st</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/burning-hands\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"burning hands\">burning hands</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/faerie-fire\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"faerie fire\">faerie fire</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>3rd</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/flaming-sphere\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"flaming sphere\">flaming sphere</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scorching-ray\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"scorching ray\">scorching ray</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>5th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/daylight\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"daylight\">daylight</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"fireball\">fireball</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>7th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/guardian-of-faith\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"guardian of faith\">guardian of faith</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wall-of-fire\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"wall of fire\">wall of fire</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>9th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/flame-strike\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"flame strike\">flame strike</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scrying\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"scrying\">scrying</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h4>Bonus Cantrip</h4><p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/light\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"light\">light</a> cantrip if you don’t already know it.</p><h4>Warding Flare</h4><p>Also at 1st level, you can interpose divine light between yourself and an attacking enemy. When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can’t be <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded\">blinded</a> is immune to this feature.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h4>Channel Divinity: Radiance of the Dawn</h4><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness sunlight, banishing darkness and dealing radiant damage to your foes.</p><p>As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.</p><h4>Improved Flare</h4><p>Starting at 6th level, you can also use your Warding Flare feature when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you attacks a creature other than you.</p><h4>Potent Spellcasting</h4><p>Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.</p><h4>Corona of Light</h4><p>Starting at 17th level, you can use your action to activate an aura of sunlight that lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it using another action. You emit bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light 30 feet beyond that. Your enemies in the bright light have disadvantage on saving throws against any spell that deals fire or radiant damage.</p><h3>Nature Domain</h3><p>Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself, from inscrutable gods of the deep forests (such as Silvanus, Obad-Hai, Chislev, Balinor, and Pan) to friendly deities associated with particular springs and groves (such as Eldath). Druids revere nature as a whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god. These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither the crops of those who anger their gods.</p><h4>Nature Domain Spells</h4><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\">Cleric Level</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Spells</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p>1st</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/animal-friendship\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"animal friendship\">animal friendship</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/speak-with-animals\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"speak with animals\">speak with animals</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>3rd</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/barkskin\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"barkskin\">barkskin</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/spike-growth\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"spike growth\">spike growth</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>5th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plant-growth\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"plant growth\">plant growth</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wind-wall\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"wind wall\">wind wall</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>7th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dominate-beast\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dominate beast\">dominate beast</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/grasping-vine\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"grasping vine\">grasping vine</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>9th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/insect-plague\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"insect plague\">insect plague</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/tree-stride\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"tree stride\">tree stride</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h4>Acolyte of Nature</h4><p>At 1st level, you learn one druid cantrip of your choice.

Each beast or plant creature that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a> by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While it is <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a> by you, it is friendly to you and other creatures you designate.</p><h4>Dampen Elements</h4><p>Starting at 6th level, when you or a creature within 30 feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to grant resistance to the creature against that instance of the damage.</p><h4>Divine Strike</h4><p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold, fire, or lightning damage (your choice) to the target.

They include gods of lightning and thunder, gods of earthquakes, some fire gods, and certain gods of violence, physical strength, and courage. In some pantheons, a god of this domain rules over other deities and is known for swift justice delivered by thunderbolts. In the pantheons of seafaring people, gods of this domain are ocean deities and the patrons of sailors. Tempest gods send their clerics to inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath.</p><h4>Tempest Domain Spells</h4><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Cleric Level</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Spells</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p>1st</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fog-cloud\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"fog cloud\">fog cloud</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/thunderwave\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"thunderwave\">thunderwave</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>3rd</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gust-of-wind\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"gust of wind\">gust of wind</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/shatter\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"shatter\">shatter</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>5th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/call-lightning\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"call lightning\">call lightning</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/sleet-storm\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"sleet storm\">sleet storm</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>7th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/control-water\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"control water\">control water</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/ice-storm\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"ice storm\">ice storm</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>9th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/destructive-wave\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"destructive wave\">destructive wave</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/insect-plague\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"insect plague\">insect plague</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h4>Bonus Proficiencies</h4><p>At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armor.</p><h4>Wrath of the Storm</h4><p>Also at 1st level, you can thunderously rebuke attackers.

They’re patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than direct confrontation.</p><h4>Trickery Domain Spells</h4><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Cleric Level</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Spells</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p>1st</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/charm-person\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"charm person\">charm person</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/disguise-self\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"disguise self\">disguise self</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>3rd</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mirror-image\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"mirror image\">mirror image</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/pass-without-trace\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"pass without trace\">pass without trace</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>5th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/blink\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"blink\">blink</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dispel magic\">dispel magic</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>7th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dimension-door\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dimension door\">dimension door</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/polymorph\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"polymorph\">polymorph</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>9th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dominate-person\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dominate person\">dominate person</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/modify-memory\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"modify memory\">modify memory</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h4>Blessing of the Trickster</h4><p>Starting when you choose this domain at 1st level, you can use your action to touch a willing creature other than yourself to give it advantage on Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth\">Stealth</a>) checks.

The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.</p><p>For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion’s space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.</p><h4>Channel Divinity: Cloak of Shadows</h4><p>Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to vanish.</p><p>As an action, you become <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible\">invisible</a> until the end of your next turn.

Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 poison damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p><h4>Improved Duplicity</h4><p>At 17th level, you can create up to four duplicates of yourself, instead of one, when you use Invoke Duplicity. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move any number of them up to 30 feet, to a maximum range of 120 feet.</p><h3>War Domain</h3><p>War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and Kiri-Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet). Other war gods (such as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.</p><h4>War Domain Spells</h4><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Cleric Level</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Spells</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p>1st</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/divine-favor\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"divine favor\">divine favor</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/shield-of-faith\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"shield of faith\">shield of faith</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>3rd</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-weapon\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"magic weapon\">magic weapon</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/spiritual-weapon\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"spiritual weapon\">spiritual weapon</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>5th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/crusaders-mantle\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"crusader’s mantle\">crusader’s mantle</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/spirit-guardians\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"spirit guardians\">spirit guardians</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>7th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/freedom-of-movement\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"freedom of movement\">freedom of movement</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/stoneskin\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"stoneskin\">stoneskin</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after- _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p>9th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table--no-space-after- Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/flame-strike\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"flame strike\">flame strike</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hold-monster\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"hold monster\">hold monster</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h4>Bonus Proficiencies</h4><p>At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armor.</p><h4>War Priest</h4><p>From 1st level, your god delivers bolts of inspiration to you while you are engaged in battle. When you use the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\">Attack</a> action , you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h4>Channel Divinity: Guided Strike</h4><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to strike with supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.</p><h4>Channel Divinity: War God’s Blessing</h4><p>At 6th level, when a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant that creature a +10 bonus to the roll, using your Channel Divinity. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.</p><h4>Divine Strike</h4><p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p><h4>Avatar of Battle</h4><p>At 17th level, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.</p><h2>Druid</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/693/c3druidintro.png\"></p><p>Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons the fury of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning to smite the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest.</p><p>Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the cultists’ activities.</p><p>Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking semblance of life.</p><p>Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature’s resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature’s indomitable will.</p><h3>Power of Nature</h3><p>Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.</p><p>Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals — the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.</p><h3>Preserve the Balance</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/692/c3druid1.png\"></p><p>For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world — air, earth, fire, and water — must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.</p><p>Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids’ territory.</p><p>Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature’s balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.</p><h3>Creating a Druid</h3><p>When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character’s destiny.</p><p>Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.</p><h4>Quick Build</h4><p>You can make a druid quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background.</p><div><table class=\"compendium-horizontal-scroll-table compendium-no-left-right-padding-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-3\">\n<th

href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival\">Survival</a></p><h4>Equipment</h4><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a wooden shield or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) any simple weapon</li>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a scimitar or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) any simple melee weapon</li>\n<li>Leather armor, an explorer’s pack, and a druidic focus</li>\n</ul><h3>Druidic</h3><p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) check but can’t decipher it without magic.</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See <a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting\">chapter 10</a> for the general rules of spellcasting and <a title=\"Spells\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spells\">chapter 11</a> for the druid&nbsp;spell list.</p><h4>Cantrips</h4><p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p><h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4><p>The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"cure wounds\">cure wounds</a>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4><p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><h4>Ritual Casting</h4><p>You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p><h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4><p>You can use a druidic focus (see chapter 5, “<a title=\"Druidic Focus\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#DruidicFocus\">Equip­ment</a>”) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>SACRED PLANTS AND WOOD</strong></p>\n<p>A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p>\n<p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p>\n</blockquote><h3>Wild Shape</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed.</p><p><strong>Beast Shapes</strong></p><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Level</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Max. CR</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Limitations</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Example</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1/4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">No flying or swimming speed</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wolf</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1/2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">No flying speed</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Crocodile</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">—</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Giant eagle</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p>You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\">unconscious</a>, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p><p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p><ul>\n<li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\n<li>When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\">unconscious</a>.</li>\n<li>You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/call-lightning\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"call lightning\">call lightning</a>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\n<li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision\">darkvision</a>, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\n<li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\n</ul><h3>Druid Circle</h3><p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h3>Timeless Body</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.</p><h3>Beast Spells</h3><p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components.</p><h3>Archdruid</h3><p>At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.</p><p>Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.</p><h2>Druid Circles</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/689/c3druid2.png\"></p><p>Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nominally members of this druidic society, though some individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and sisters. Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids sometimes compete with or even prey on each other.</p><p>At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the way of the druid.</p><h3>Circle of the Land</h3><p>The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites.</p><h4>Bonus Cantrip</h4><p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.</p><h4>Natural Recovery</h4><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.</p><h4>Circle Spells</h4><p>Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land — arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark — and consult the associated list of spells.</p><p>Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p><h5>Arctic</h5><div><table

You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p><p>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/entangle\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"entangle\">entangle</a> spell.</p><h4>Nature’s Ward</h4><p>When you reach 10th level, you can’t be <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.</p><h4>Nature’s Sanctuary</h4><p>When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p><p>The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.</p><h3>Circle of the Moon</h3><p>Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks on end before crossing paths with another humanoid creature, let alone another druid.</p><p>Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the druid’s blood.</p><h4>Combat Wild Shape</h4><p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action.</p><p>Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.</p><h4>Circle Forms</h4><p>The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there).</p><p>Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down.</p><h4>Primal Strike</h4><p>Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><h4>Elemental Wild Shape</h4><p>At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into an <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/air-elemental\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"air elemental\">air elemental</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/earth-elemental\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"earth elemental\">earth elemental</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/fire-elemental\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"fire elemental\">fire elemental</a>, or a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/water-elemental\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"water elemental\">water elemental</a>.</p><h4>Thousand Forms</h4><p>By 14th level, you have learned to use magic to alter your physical form in more subtle ways.

The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers, and others who live closely with nature. This tradition includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa.</p>\n<p>In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy of veneration.</p>\n<p>The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of the other religions of the world. They believe that every living thing and every natural phenomenon — sun, moon, wind, fire, and the world itself — has a spirit. Their spells, then, are a means to communicate with and command these spirits. Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature, the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the world from the incursion of aberrations.</p>\n</blockquote><h2>Fighter</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/697/c3fighterintro.png\"></p><p>A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield before her as she runs toward the massed goblins. An elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.</p><p>A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre’s club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.</p><p>A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd’s delight — and his own tactical advantage. His opponent’s sword flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite him.</p><p>All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings — as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.</p><h3>Well-Rounded Specialists</h3><p>Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.</p><h3>Trained for Danger</h3><p>Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen’s army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.</p><p>Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards — few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/flame-tongue\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"flame tongue\">flame tongue</a> sword, for example.</p><h3>Creating a Fighter</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/694/c3fighter1.png\"></p><p>As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character’s background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.</p><p>You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught — unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions — the only things that stand between you and death’s embrace.</p><h4>Quick Build</h4><p>You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Constitution, or Intelligence if you plan to adopt the Eldritch Knight martial archetype. Second, choose the soldier background.</p><div><table class=\"compendium-horizontal-scroll-table compendium-no-left-right-padding-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-20\">\n<th

href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival\">Survival</a></p><h4>Equipment</h4><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) chain mail or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) leather armor, longbow, and 20 arrows</li>\n<li>(<span

class=\"italic\">b</span>) two handaxes</li>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n</ul><h3>Fighting Style</h3><p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p><h4>Archery</h4><p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p><h4>Defense</h4><p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p><h4>Dueling</h4><p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p><h4>Great Weapon Fighting</h4><p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p><h4>Protection</h4><p>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</p><h4>Two-Weapon Fighting</h4><p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p><h3>Second Wind</h3><p>You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p><h3>Action Surge</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.</p><h3>Martial Archetype</h3><p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. Choose Champion, Battle Master, or Eldritch Knight, all detailed at the end of the class description. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.</p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h3>Extra Attack</h3><p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\">Attack</a> action on your turn.</p><p>The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.</p><h3>Indomitable</h3><p>Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.</p><h2>Martial Archetypes</h2><p>Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.</p><h3>Champion</h3><p>The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows.</p><h4>Improved Critical</h4><p>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p><h4>Remarkable Athlete</h4><p>Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn’t already use your proficiency bonus.</p><p>In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier.</p><h4>Additional Fighting Style</h4><p>At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature.</p><h4>Superior Critical</h4><p>Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18–20.</p><h4>Survivor</h4><p>At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don’t gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.</p><h3>Battle Master</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/695/c3fighter2.png\"></p><p>Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.</p><h4>Combat Superiority</h4><p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Maneuvers. </span>You learn three maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under “Maneuvers” below. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.</p><p>You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Superiority Dice. </span>You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Saving Throws. </span>Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Maneuver save DC</span> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)</p><h4>Student of War</h4><p>At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan’s tools of your choice.</p><h4>Know Your Enemy</h4><p>Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:</p><ul>\n<li>Strength score</li>\n<li>Dexterity score</li>\n<li>Constitution score</li>\n<li>Armor Class</li>\n<li>Current hit points</li>\n<li>Total class levels (if any)</li>\n<li>Fighter class levels (if any)</li>\n</ul><h4>Improved Combat Superiority</h4><p>At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into d12s.</p><h4>Relentless</h4><p>Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain one superiority die.</p><h4>Maneuvers</h4><p>The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Commander’s Strike. </span>When you take the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\">Attack</a> action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Disarming Attack. </span>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it’s holding. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Distracting Strike. </span>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Evasive Footwork. </span>When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Feinting Attack. </span>You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature this turn. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Goading Attack. </span>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Lunging Attack. </span>When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Maneuvering Attack.</span> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Menacing Attack. </span>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> of you until the end of your next turn.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Parry. </span>When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Precision Attack. </span>When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Pushing Attack. </span>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Rally. </span>On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Riposte. </span>When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Sweeping Attack. </span>When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Trip Attack.</span> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a>.</p><h3>Eldritch Knight</h3><p>The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter’s reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.</p><h4>Spellcasting</h4><p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells. See <a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting\">chapter 10</a> for the general rules of spellcasting and <a title=\"Spells\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spells\">chapter 11</a> for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Cantrips. </span>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Spell Slots.</span> The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/shield\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"shield\">shield</a> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/shield\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"shield\">shield</a> using either slot.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</span> You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p><p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p><h4>Eldritch Knight Spellcasting</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"987585652\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[GXzoEvFwmiZbvNsZ]{Fighter Level: CantripsKnown}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"987585653\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[1XE74ymQZEXXjuY2]{Fighter Level: SpellsKnown}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"987585654\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[BNtSOtAdk7UPZZhf]{Fighter Level: Spell Slots Per Level, 1st}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"987585655\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[14dkdOy6R7v6YwbG]{Fighter Level: Spell Slots Per Level, 2nd}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"987585656\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[85AkbJfZuozpdCna]{Fighter Level: Spell Slots Per Level, 3rd}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"987585657\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[wm8WPklFSaMIM6FL]{Fighter Level: Spell Slots Per Level, 4th}</span></div></div></div><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Spellcasting Ability. </span>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><h4>Weapon Bond</h4><p>At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.</p><p>Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can’t be disarmed of that weapon unless you are <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a>. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</p><p>You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.</p><h4>War Magic</h4><p>Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p><h4>Eldritch Strike</h4><p>At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature’s resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.</p><h4>Arcane Charge</h4><p>At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the additional action.</p><h4>Improved War Magic</h4><p>Starting at 18th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p><h2>Monk</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/700/c3monkintro.png\"></p><p>Her fists a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of arrows, a half-elf springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed ranks of hobgoblins on the other side. She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging orcs reach him, he exhales and a blast of fire roars from his mouth, engulfing his foes.</p><p>Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad halfling steps into a shadow beneath an arch and emerges from another inky shadow on a balcony a stone’s throw away. She slides her blade free of its cloth-wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.</p><p>Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.</p><h3>The Magic of Ki</h3><p>Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call <strong>ki</strong>. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse — specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies’ physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.</p><h3>Training and Asceticism</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/699/c3monk1.png\"></p><p>Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&amp;D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn’t be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.</p><p>Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power.</p><p>The majority of monks don’t shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.</p><p>For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don’t undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.</p><h3>Creating a Monk</h3><p>As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery’s threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?</p><p>Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community’s rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?</p><p>As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness ki, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.</p><h4>Quick Build</h4><p>You can make a monk quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the hermit background.</p><div><table class=\"compendium-horizontal-scroll-table compendium-no-left-right-padding-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-20\">\n<th

monk, you gain the following class features.</p><h4>Hit Points</h4><p><span class=\"bold\">Hit Dice:</span> 1d8 per monk level</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span> 8 + your Constitution modifier</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per monk level after 1st</p><h4>Proficiencies</h4><p><span

instrument</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Saving Throws: </span>Strength, Dexterity</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Skills:</span> Choose two from <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#History\">History</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Insight\">Insight</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Religion\">Religion</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth\">Stealth</a></p><h4>Equipment</h4><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a shortsword or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) any simple weapon</li>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li>10 darts</li>\n</ul><h3>Unarmored Defense</h3><p>Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p><h3>Martial Arts</h3><p>At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.</p><p>You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p><ul>\n<li>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>\n<li>You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li>\n<li>When you use the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\">Attack</a> action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\">Attack</a> action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.</li>\n</ul><p>Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in chapter 5, “<a title=\"Weapons\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#Weapons\">Equipment</a>.”</p><h3>Ki</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.</p><p>You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.</p><p>When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</p><p>Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Ki save DC </span>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><h4>Flurry of Blows</h4><p>Immediately after you take the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\">Attack</a> action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p><h4>Patient Defense</h4><p>You can spend 1 ki point to take the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dodge\">Dodge</a> action as a bonus action on your turn.</p><h4>Step of the Wind</h4><p>You can spend 1 ki point to take the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Disengage\">Disengage</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash\">Dash</a> action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p><h3>Unarmored Movement</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.</p><p>At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.</p><h3>Monastic Tradition</h3><p>When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of the Four Elements, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p><h3>Deflect Missiles</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</p><p>If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h3>Slow Fall</h3><p>Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.</p><h3>Extra Attack</h3><p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\">Attack</a> action on your turn.</p><h3>Stunning Strike</h3><p>Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Stunned\">stunned</a> until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Ki-Empowered Strikes</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><h3>Evasion</h3><p>At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"fireball\">fireball</a> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p><h3>Stillness of Mind</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a>.</p><h3>Purity of Body</h3><p>At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.</p><h3>Tongue of the Sun and Moon</h3><p>Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.</p><h3>Diamond Soul</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.</p><p>Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.</p><h3>Timeless Body</h3><p>At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.</p><h3>Empty Body</h3><p>Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible\">invisible</a> for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.</p><p>Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/astral-projection\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"astral projection\">astral projection</a> spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you.</p><h3>Perfect Self</h3><p>At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.</p><h2>Monastic Traditions</h2><p>Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.</p><h3>Way of the Open Hand</h3><p>Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.</p><h4>Open Hand Technique</h4><p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy’s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:</p><ul>\n<li>It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a>.</li>\n<li>It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.</li>\n<li>It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.</li>\n</ul><h4>Wholeness of Body</h4><p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.</p><h4>Tranquility</h4><p>Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/sanctuary\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"sanctuary\">sanctuary</a> spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p><h4>Quivering Palm</h4><p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.</p><p>You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.</p><h3>Way of Shadow</h3><p>Monks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that values stealth and subterfuge. These monks might be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as spies and assassins. Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves’ guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the heads of these monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience of their students.</p><h4>Shadow Arts</h4><p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can use your ki to duplicate the effects of certain spells. As an action, you can spend 2 ki points to cast <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/darkness\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"darkness\">darkness</a></span>, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/darkvision\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"darkvision\">darkvision</a></span>, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/pass-without-trace\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"pass without trace\">pass without trace</a></span>, or <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/silence\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"silence\">silence</a></span>, without providing material components. Additionally, you gain the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/minor-illusion\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"minor illusion\">minor illusion</a></span> cantrip if you don’t already know it.</p><h4>Shadow Step</h4><p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn.</p><h4>Cloak of Shadows</h4><p>By 11th level, you have learned to become one with the shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible\">invisible</a>. You remain <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible\">invisible</a> until you make an attack, cast a spell, or are in an area of bright light.</p><h4>Opportunist</h4><p>At 17th level, you can exploit a creature’s momentary distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack made by a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.</p><h3>Way of the Four Elements</h3><p>You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but others weave the elements together.</p><p>Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains, and cresting waves.</p><h4>Disciple of the Elements</h4><p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it.</p><p>You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and one other elemental discipline of your choice, which are detailed in the “Elemental Disciplines” section below. You learn one additional elemental discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p><p>Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Casting Elemental Spells.</span> Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. See <a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting\">chapter 10</a> for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don’t need to provide material components for it.</p><p>Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as <span class=\"italic\">burning hands</span> does. The spell’s level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/burning-hands\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"burning hands\">burning hands</a>, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline’s base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).</p><p>The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table.</p><h4>Spells and Ki Points</h4><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\">Monk Levels</th>\n<th>Maximum Ki Points for a Spell</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>5th–8th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th–12th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th–16th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th–20th</td>\n<td>6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h4>Elemental Disciplines</h4><p>The elemental disciplines are presented in alphabetical order.

You can change water to ice within the area and vice versa, and you can reshape ice in the area in any manner you choose. You can raise or lower the ice’s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension.

In lands with an Asian cultural flavor, such as Shou Lung far to the east of the Forgotten Realms, these monasteries are associated with philosophical traditions and martial arts practice. The Iron Hand School, the Five Stars School, the Northern Fist School, and the Southern Star School of Shou Lung teach different approaches to the physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines of the monk. Some of these monasteries have spread to the western lands of Faerûn, particularly in places with large Shou immigrant communities, such as Thesk and Westgate.</p>\n<p>Other monastic traditions are associated with deities who teach the value of physical excellence and mental discipline. In the Forgotten Realms, the order of the Dark Moon is made up of monks dedicated to Shar (goddess of loss), who maintain secret communities in remote hills, back allies, and subterranean hideaways. Monasteries of Ilmater (god of endurance) are named after flowers, and their orders carry the names of great heroes of the faith; the Disciples of Saint Sollars the Twice-Martyred reside in the Monastery of the Yellow Rose near Damara. The monasteries of Eberron combine the study of martial arts with a life of scholarship. Most are devoted to the deities of the Sovereign Host. In the world of Dragonlance, most monks are devoted to Majere, god of meditation and thought. In Greyhawk, many monasteries are dedicated to Xan Yae, the goddess of twilight and the superiority of mind over matter, or to Zuoken, god of mental and physical mastery.</p>\n<p>The evil monks of the Scarlet Brotherhood in the world of Greyhawk derive their fanatic zeal not from devotion to a god but from dedication to the principles of their nation and their race—the belief that the Suel strand of humanity are meant to rule the world.</p>\n</blockquote><h2>Paladin</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/701/c3paladinintro.png\"></p><p>Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man’s wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.</p><p>A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.</p><p>Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.</p><p>Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god’s altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.</p><h3>The Cause of Righteousness</h3><p>A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin’s power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.</p><p>Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice.</p><h3>Beyond the Mundane Life</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/702/c3paladin1.png\"></p><p>Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.</p><p>Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.</p><h3>Creating a Paladin</h3><p>The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don’t appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? <a title=\"Gods of the Multiverse\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/appendix-b-gods-of-the-multiverse#GodsoftheMultiverse\">Appendix B</a> lists many deities worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall.</p><p>How did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event — the destruction of your home, perhaps — drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin’s life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.</p><p>As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals. Your oath and alignment might be in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of behavior that you have not yet attained.</p><h4>Quick Build</h4><p>You can make a paladin quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose the noble background.</p><div><table class=\"compendium-horizontal-scroll-table compendium-no-left-right-padding-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header CellOverride-1

features.</p><h4>Hit Points</h4><p><span class=\"bold\">Hit Dice: </span>1d10 per paladin level</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Hit Points at 1st Level: </span>10 + your Constitution modifier</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Hit Points at Higher Levels: </span>1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per paladin level after 1st</p><h4>Proficiencies</h4><p><span class=\"bold\">Armor: </span>All armor,

href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Insight\">Insight</a>, <a

href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Religion\">Religion</a></p><h4>Equipment</h4><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a martial weapon and a shield or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) two martial weapons</li>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) five javelins or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) any simple melee weapon</li>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a priest’s pack or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li>Chain mail and a holy symbol</li>\n</ul><h3>Divine Sense</h3><p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hallow\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"hallow\">hallow</a> spell.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p><h3>Lay on Hands</h3><p>Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.</p><p>As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</p><p>Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</p><p>This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p><h3>Fighting Style</h3><p>At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p><h4>Defense</h4><p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p><h4>Dueling</h4><p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p><h4>Great Weapon Fighting</h4><p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p><h4>Protection</h4><p>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See <a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting\">chapter 10</a> for the general rules of spellcasting and <a title=\"Spells\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spells\">chapter 11</a> for the paladin&nbsp;spell list.</p><h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4><p>The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"cure wounds\">cure wounds</a>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4><p>You can use a holy symbol (see chapter 5, “<a title=\"Holy Symbol\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#HolySymbol\">Equipment</a>”) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p><h3>Divine Smite</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p><h3>Divine Health</h3><p>By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p><h3>Sacred Oath</h3><p>When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class description.</p><p>Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.</p><h4>Oath Spells</h4><p>Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p><p>If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p><h4>Channel Divinity</h4><p>Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p><p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p><p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h3>Extra Attack</h3><p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\">Attack</a> action on your turn.</p><h3>Aura of Protection</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p><h3>Aura of Courage</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> while you are conscious.</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p><h3>Improved Divine Smite</h3><p>By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.</p><h3>Cleansing Touch</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Sacred Oaths</h2><p>Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>BREAKING YOUR OATH</strong></p>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the DM’s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps to take the Oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the <span class=\"italic\">Dungeon Master’s Guide.</span></p>\n</blockquote><h3>Oath of Devotion</h3><p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels — the perfect servants of good — as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</p><h4>Tenets of Devotion</h4><p>Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Honesty.</span> Don’t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Courage.</span> Never fear to act, though caution is wise.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Compassion.</span> Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Honor.</span> Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Duty.</span> Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.</p><h4>Oath Spells</h4><p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p><h5>Oath of Devotion Spells</h5><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\">Paladin Level</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Spells</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p>3rd</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"protection from evil and good\">protection from evil and good</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/sanctuary\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"sanctuary\">sanctuary</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>5th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lesser-restoration\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"lesser restoration\">lesser restoration</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/zone-of-truth\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"zone of truth\">zone of truth</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>9th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/beacon-of-hope\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"beacon of hope\">beacon of hope</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dispel magic\">dispel magic</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>13th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/freedom-of-movement\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"freedom of movement\">freedom of movement</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/guardian-of-faith\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"guardian of faith\">guardian of faith</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>17th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/commune\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"commune\">commune</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/flame-strike\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"flame strike\">flame strike</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h4>Channel Divinity</h4><p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Sacred Weapon. </span>As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.</p><p>You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\">unconscious</a>, this effect ends.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Turn the Unholy.</span> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p><p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash\">Dash</a> action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dodge\">Dodge</a> action.</p><h4>Aura of Devotion</h4><p>Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a> while you are conscious.</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p><h4>Purity of Spirit</h4><p>Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"protection from evil and good\">protection from evil and good</a> spell.</p><h4>Holy Nimbus</h4><p>At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.</p><p>Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.</p><p>In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Oath of the Ancients</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/703/c3paladin2.png\"></p><p>The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things — leaves, antlers, or flowers — to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.</p><h4>Tenets of the Ancients</h4><p>The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Kindle the Light.</span> Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Shelter the Light.</span> Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Preserve Your Own Light.</span> Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can’t preserve it in the world.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Be the Light.</span> Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.</p><h4>Oath Spells</h4><p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p><h5>Oath of the Ancients Spells</h5><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\">Paladin Level</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Spells</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p>3rd</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/ensnaring-strike\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"ensnaring strike\">ensnaring strike</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/speak-with-animals\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"speak with animals\">speak with animals</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>5th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/misty-step\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"misty step\">misty step</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/moonbeam\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"moonbeam\">moonbeam</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>9th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plant-growth\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"plant growth\">plant growth</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/protection-from-energy\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"protection from energy\">protection from energy</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>13th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/ice-storm\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"ice storm\">ice storm</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/stoneskin\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"stoneskin\">stoneskin</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>17th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/commune-with-nature\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"commune with nature\">commune with nature</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/tree-stride\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"tree stride\">tree stride</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h4>Channel Divinity</h4><p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Nature’s Wrath. </span>You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see.

For its action, it can use only the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash\">Dash</a> action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dodge\">Dodge</a> action.</p><p>If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.</p><h4>Aura of Warding</h4><p>Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage from spells.</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p><h4>Undying Sentinel</h4><p>Starting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can’t be aged magically.</p><h4>Elder Champion</h4><p>At 20th level, you can assume the form of an ancient force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose. For example, your skin might turn green or take on a bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or moss-like, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane.</p><p>Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul>\n<li>At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points.</li>\n<li>Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.</li>\n<li>Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws against your paladin spells and Channel Divinity options.</li>\n</ul><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Oath of Vengeance</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/704/c3paladin3.png\"></p><p>The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves’ guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside — at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins — sometimes called avengers or dark knights — their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.</p><h4>Tenets of Vengeance</h4><p>The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Fight the Greater Evil.</span> Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">No Mercy for the Wicked.</span> Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">By Any Means Necessary.</span> My qualms can’t get in the way of exterminating my foes.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Restitution.</span> If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.</p><h4>Oath Spells</h4><p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p><h5>Oath of Vengeance Spells</h5><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\">Paladin Level</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Spells</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p>3rd</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/bane\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"bane\">bane</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hunters-mark\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"hunter’s mark\">hunter’s mark</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>5th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hold-person\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"hold person\">hold person</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/misty-step\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"misty step\">misty step</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>9th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/haste\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"haste\">haste</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/protection-from-energy\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"protection from energy\">protection from energy</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>13th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/banishment\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"banishment\">banishment</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dimension-door\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dimension door\">dimension door</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>17th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p><span class=\"normally-italicized\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hold-monster\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"hold monster\">hold monster</a></span>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scrying\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"scrying\">scrying</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h4>Channel Divinity</h4><p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Abjure Enemy. </span>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a>. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw.</p><p>On a failed save, the creature is <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a>, the creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.</p><p>On a successful save, the creature’s speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Vow of Enmity. </span>As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\">unconscious</a>.</p><h4>Relentless Avenger</h4><p>By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe’s retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.</p><h4>Soul of Vengeance</h4><p>Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.</p><h4>Avenging Angel</h4><p>At 20th level, you can assume the form of an angelic avenger. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul>\n<li>Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.</li>\n<li>You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius. The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> creature have advantage.</li>\n</ul><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Ranger</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/707/c3rangerintro.png\"></p><p>Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.</p><p>After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon’s thick scales.</p><p>Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he’s been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.</p><p>Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.</p><h3>Deadly Hunters</h3><p>Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization — humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.</p><p>Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature’s power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger’s talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p><h3>Independent Adventurers</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/705/c3ranger1.png\"></p><p>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger’s true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first — and possibly the last — line of defense.</p><p>This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization’s foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p><h3>Creating a Ranger</h3><p>As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger’s ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain — perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.</p><p>What’s the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p><h4>Quick Build</h4><p>You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. (Some rangers who focus on two-weapon fighting make Strength higher than Dexterity.) Second, choose the outlander background.</p><div><table class=\"compendium-horizontal-scroll-table compendium-no-left-right-padding-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-3\">\n<th

href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival\">Survival</a></p><h4>Equipment</h4><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) scale mail or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) leather armor</li>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) two shortswords or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) two simple melee weapons</li>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li>A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows</li>\n</ul><h3>Favored Enemy</h3><p>Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.</p><p>Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.</p><p>You have advantage on Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival\">Survival</a>) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</p><p>When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.</p><p>You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.</p><h3>Natural Explorer</h3><p>You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.</p><p>While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul>\n<li>Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.</li>\n<li>Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.</li>\n<li>Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.</li>\n<li>If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</li>\n<li>When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.</li>\n<li>While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</li>\n</ul><p>You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.</p><h3>Fighting Style</h3><p>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. <br>You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p><h4>Archery</h4><p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p><h4>Defense</h4><p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p><h4>Dueling</h4><p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p><h4>Two-Weapon Fighting</h4><p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See <a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting\">chapter 10</a> for the general rules of spellcasting and <a title=\"Spells\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spells\">chapter 11</a> for the ranger&nbsp;spell list.</p><h4>Spell Slots</h4><p>The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/animal-friendship\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"animal friendship\">animal friendship</a> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/animal-friendship\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"animal friendship\">animal friendship</a> using either slot.</p><h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4><p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4><p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><h3>Ranger Archetype</h3><p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p><h3>Primeval Awareness</h3><p>Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.</p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h3>Extra Attack</h3><p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\">Attack</a> action on your turn.</p><h3>Land’s Stride</h3><p>Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p><p>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/entangle\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"entangle\">entangle</a> spell.</p><h3>Hide in Plain Sight</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.</p><p>Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth\">Stealth</a>) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.</p><h3>Vanish</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, you can use the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Hide\">Hide</a> action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.</p><h3>Feral Senses</h3><p>At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.</p><p>You are also aware of the location of any <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible\">invisible</a> creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded\">blinded</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Deafened\">deafened</a>.</p><h3>Foe Slayer</h3><p>At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.</p><h2>Ranger Archetypes</h2><p>The ideal of the ranger has two classic expressions: the Hunter and the Beast Master.</p><h3>Hunter</h3><p>Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter’s path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons.</p><h4>Hunter’s Prey</h4><p>At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Colossus Slayer.</span> Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it’s below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Giant Killer.</span> When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Horde Breaker.</span> Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.</p><h4>Defensive Tactics</h4><p>At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Escape the Horde.</span> Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Multiattack Defense.</span> When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Steel Will.</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a>.</p><h4>Multiattack</h4><p>At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Volley.</span> You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon’s range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Whirlwind Attack.</span> You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.</p><h4>Superior Hunter’s Defense</h4><p>At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Evasion. </span>When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lightning-bolt\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"lightning bolt\">lightning bolt</a> spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Stand Against the Tide. </span>When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Uncanny Dodge. </span>When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.</p><h3>Beast Master</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/706/c3ranger2.png\"></p><p>The Beast Master archetype embodies a friendship between the civilized races and the beasts of the wild. United in focus, beast and ranger fight the monsters that threaten civilization and the wilderness alike.</p><h4>Ranger’s Companion</h4><p>At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower (<a title=\"Creature Statistics\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/appendix-d-creature-statistics\">appendix D</a>&nbsp;presents statistics for the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hawk\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"hawk\">hawk</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mastiff\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"mastiff\">mastiff</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/panther\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"panther\">panther</a> as examples). Add your proficiency bonus to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals the hit point number in its stat block or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher. Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to regain hit points.</p><p>The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\">Attack</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash\">Dash</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Disengage\">Disengage</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Help\">Help</a> action. If you don't issue a command, the beast takes the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dodge\">Dodge</a> action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\">Attack</a> action.</p><p>If you are <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a> or absent, the beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. The beast never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.</p><p>While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</p><p>If the beast dies, you can obtain a new companion by spending 8 hours magically bonding with a beast that isn’t hostile to you and that meets the requirements.</p><h4>Exceptional Training</h4><p>Beginning at 7th level, on any of your turns when your beast companion doesn’t attack, you can use a bonus action to command the beast to take the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash\">Dash</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Disengage\">Disengage</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Help\">Help</a> action on its turn.</p><p>In addition, the beast's attacks now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><h4>Bestial Fury</h4><p>Starting at 11th level, when you command your beast companion to take the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\">Attack</a> action , the beast can make two attacks, or it can take the Multiattack action if it has that action.</p><h4>Share Spells</h4><p>Beginning at 15th level, when you cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect your beast companion with the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of you.</p><h2>Rogue</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/709/c3rogueintro.png\"></p><p>Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open.</p><p>A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target — a notorious slaver — passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.</p><p>Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically lifts the key ring from the guard’s belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.</p><p>Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.</p><h3>Skill and Precision</h3><p>Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p><p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.</p><h3>A Shady Living</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/708/c3rogue1.png\"></p><p>Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves’ guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats — and wererats — haunt the sewers.</p><p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p><h3>Creating a Rogue</h3><p>As you create your rogue character, consider the character’s relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past — or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?</p><p>What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend — another member of your adventuring party — who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.</p><h4>Quick Build</h4><p>You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your next-highest if you want to excel at <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\">Investigation</a> or plan to take up the Arcane Trickster archetype. Choose Charisma instead if you plan to emphasize deception and social interaction. Second, choose the charlatan background.</p><div><table class=\"compendium-horizontal-scroll-table compendium-no-left-right-padding-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-20\">\n<th

href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth\">Stealth</a></p><h4>Equipment</h4><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a rapier or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) a shortsword</li>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) a shortsword</li>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a burglar’s pack, (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (<span class=\"italic\">c</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li>Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves’ tools</li>\n</ul><h3>Expertise</h3><p>At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p><p>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.</p><h3>Sneak Attack</h3><p>Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p><p>You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a>, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p><p>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p><h3>Thieves’ Cant</h3><p>During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p><p>In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p><h3>Cunning Action</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash\">Dash</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Disengage\">Disengage</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Hide\">Hide</a> action.</p><h3>Roguish Archetype</h3><p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h3>Uncanny Dodge</h3><p>Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.</p><h3>Evasion</h3><p>Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/ice-storm\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"ice storm\">ice storm</a> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p><h3>Reliable Talent</h3><p>By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p><h3>Blindsense</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible\">invisible</a> creature within 10 feet of you.</p><h3>Slippery Mind</h3><p>By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p><h3>Elusive</h3><p>Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a>.</p><h3>Stroke of Luck</h3><p>At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Roguish Archetypes</h2><p>Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus — not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.</p><h3>Thief</h3><p>You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ.</p><h4>Fast Hands</h4><p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#SleightofHand\">Sleight of Hand</a>) check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#UseanObject\">Use an Object</a> action.</p><h4>Second-Story Work</h4><p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.</p><p>In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.</p><h4>Supreme Sneak</h4><p>Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth\">Stealth</a>) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.</p><h4>Use Magic Device</h4><p>By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.</p><h4>Thief’s Reflexes</h4><p>When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature when you are surprised.</p><h3>Assassin</h3><p>You focus your training on the grim art of death. Those who adhere to this archetype are diverse: hired killers, spies, bounty hunters, and even specially anointed priests trained to exterminate the enemies of their deity. Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your foes with deadly efficiency.</p><h4>Bonus Proficiencies</h4><p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner’s kit.</p><h4>Assassinate</h4><p>Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.</p><h4>Infiltration Expertise</h4><p>Starting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. You can’t establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official-looking certification to establish yourself as a member of a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants.</p><p>Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.</p><h4>Impostor</h4><p>At 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person’s speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least three hours studying these three components of the person’s behavior, listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms.</p><p>Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Deception\">Deception</a>) check you make to avoid detection.</p><h4>Death Strike</h4><p>Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.</p><h3>Arcane Trickster</h3><p>Some rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility with magic, learning tricks of enchantment and illusion. These rogues include pickpockets and burglars, but also pranksters, mischief-makers, and a significant number of adventurers.</p><h4>Spellcasting</h4><p>When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells. See <a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting\">chapter 10</a> for the general rules of spellcasting and <a title=\"Spells\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spells\">chapter 11</a> for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Cantrips.</span> You learn three cantrips: <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mage-hand\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"mage hand\">mage hand</a> and two other cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn another wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Spell Slots. </span>The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/charm-person\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"charm person\">charm person</a> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/charm-person\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"charm person\">charm person</a> using either slot.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</span> You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the wizard spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p><p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p><h4>Arcane Trickster Spellcasting</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1606871531\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[h1TmnsBDNpIkTUdk]{RogueLevel: CantripsKnown}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1606871532\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[7E310XZOoGdL4D1x]{RogueLevel: SpellsKnown}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1606871533\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[FJJpT72H6nrqtDGR]{RogueLevel: Spell Slots Per Level, 1st}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1606871534\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[gjrFGK41Yr3326gy]{RogueLevel: Spell Slots Per Level, 2nd}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1606871535\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[ydmMSh3Kq9PbGGpJ]{RogueLevel: Spell Slots Per Level, 3rd}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1606871536\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[9qbboSn4B8vW3fhH]{RogueLevel: Spell Slots Per Level, 4th}</span></div></div></div><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Spellcasting Ability.</span> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><h4>Mage Hand Legerdemain</h4><p>Starting at 3rd level, when you cast <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mage-hand\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"mage hand\">mage hand</a>, you can make the spectral hand <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible\">invisible</a>, and you can perform the following additional tasks with it:</p><ul>\n<li>You can stow one object the hand is holding in a container worn or carried by another creature.</li>\n<li>You can retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another creature.</li>\n<li>You can use thieves’ tools to pick locks and disarm traps at range.</li>\n</ul><p>You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#SleightofHand\">Sleight of Hand</a>) check contested by the creature’s Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) check.</p><p>In addition, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to control the hand.</p><h4>Magical Ambush</h4><p>Starting at 9th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell this turn.</p><h4>Versatile Trickster</h4><p>At 13th level, you gain the ability to distract targets with your <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mage-hand\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"mage hand\">mage hand</a>. As a bonus action on your turn, you can designate a creature within 5 feet of the spectral hand created by the spell. Doing so gives you advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of the turn.</p><h4>Spell Thief</h4><p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.</p><p>Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell’s effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast (it doesn’t need to be a wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using your spell slots. The creature can’t cast that spell until the 8 hours have passed.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Sorcerer</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/712/c3sorcererintro.png\"></p><p>Golden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she takes to the air.</p><p>Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.</p><p>Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.</p><p>Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.</p><h3>Raw Magic</h3><p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.</p><p>The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby’s birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.</p><p>Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.</p><h3>Unexplained Powers</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/710/c3sorcerer1.png\"></p><p>Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn’t like to stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn’t called on.</p><p>Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.</p><h3>Creating a Sorcerer</h3><p>The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you’ll choose an origin that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?</p><p>How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you’ve been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world — the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.</p><h4>Quick Build</h4><p>You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions.

granted by your background:</p><ul>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) any simple weapon</li>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a component pouch or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) an arcane focus</li>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li>Two daggers</li>\n</ul><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See <a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting\">chapter 10</a> for the general rules of spellcasting and <a title=\"Spells\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spells\">chapter 11</a> for the sorcerer&nbsp;spell list.</p><h4>Cantrips</h4><p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.</p><h4>Spell Slots</h4><p>The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span class=\"italic\">burning hands</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/burning-hands\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"burning hands\">burning hands</a> using either slot.</p><h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4><p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4><p>You can use an arcane focus (see chapter 5, “<a title=\"Arcane Focus\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Equip­ment</a>”) as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.</p><h3>Sorcerous Origin</h3><p>Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline or Wild Magic, both detailed at the end of the class description.</p><p>Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.</p><h3>Font of Magic</h3><p>At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.</p><h4>Sorcery Points</h4><p>You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.</p><h4>Flexible Casting</h4><p>You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Creating Spell Slots.</span> You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.</p><p>Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.</p><h4>Creating Spell Slots</h4><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\">Spell Slot Level</th>\n<th>Sorcery Point Cost</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points.</span> As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot’s level.</p><h3>Metamagic</h3><p>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.</p><p>You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.</p><h4>Careful Spell</h4><p>When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.</p><h4>Distant Spell</h4><p>When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.</p><p>When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.</p><h4>Empowered Spell</h4><p>When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.</p><p>You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.</p><h4>Extended Spell</h4><p>When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.</p><h4>Heightened Spell</h4><p>When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.</p><h4>Quickened Spell</h4><p>When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.</p><h4>Subtle Spell</h4><p>When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.</p><h4>Twinned Spell</h4><p>When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).</p><p>To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level. For example, <span class=\"italic\">magic missile</span> and <span class=\"italic\">scorching ray</span> aren’t eligible, but <span class=\"italic\">ray of frost</span> and <span class=\"italic\">chromatic orb</span> are.</p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h3>Sorcerous Restoration</h3><p>At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.</p><h2>Sorcerous Origins</h2><p>Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a draconic bloodline and wild magic.</p><h3>Draconic Bloodline</h3><p>Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.</p><h4>Dragon Ancestor</h4><p>At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.</p><h4>Draconic Ancestry</h4><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Dragon</th>\n<th>Damage Type</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Black</td>\n<td>Acid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Blue</td>\n<td>Lightning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Brass</td>\n<td>Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Bronze</td>\n<td>Lightning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Copper</td>\n<td>Acid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Gold</td>\n<td>Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Green</td>\n<td>Poison</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Red</td>\n<td>Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Silver</td>\n<td>Cold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">White</td>\n<td>Cold</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p>You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.</p><h4>Draconic Resilience</h4><p>As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.</p><p>Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.</p><h4>Elemental Affinity</h4><p>Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.</p><h4>Dragon Wings</h4><p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.</p><p>You can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.</p><h4>Draconic Presence</h4><p>Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a>. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a> (if you chose awe) or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.</p><h3>Wild Magic</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/714/c3sorcerer2.png\"></p><p>Your innate magic comes from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or the Far Realm. Perhaps you were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with no apparent cause. However it came to be, this magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.</p><h4>Wild Magic Surge</h4><p>Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, the DM can have you roll a d20 immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect. If that effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn’t require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.</p><h4>Tides of Chaos</h4><p>Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.</p><p>Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this feature.</p><h4>Bend Luck</h4><p>Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature’s roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.</p><h4>Controlled Chaos</h4><p>At 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use either number.</p><h4>Spell Bombardment</h4><p>Beginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.</p><h4>Wild Magic Surge</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1895821558\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[oV6T8jSPnoMmbdLD]{Effect}</span></div></div></div><h2>Warlock</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/716/c3warlockintro.png\"></p><p>With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace sentinel to his will.</p><p>As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened human whispers the secret name of her demonic patron, infusing her spell with fiendish magic.</p><p>Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a distant world.</p><p>Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.</p><h3>Sworn and Beholden</h3><p>A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity — beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron’s behalf.</p><p>The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock’s being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.</p><h3>Delvers into Secrets</h3><p>Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well.</p><p>Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student’s mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.</p><p>Once a pact is made, a warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn’t intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.</p><h3>Creating a Warlock</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/715/c3warlock1.png\"></p><p>As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with your patron? Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron, or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of the rewards promised to you?</p><p>Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in your character’s adventuring career. Your patron’s demands might drive you into adventures, or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do between adventures.</p><p>What kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? How important does your patron consider you to be? What part do you play in your patron’s plans? Do you know other servants of your patron?</p><p>How does your patron communicate with you? If you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with your patron’s voice. Some warlocks find messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea leaves, or adrift in the clouds — messages that only the warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with intermediaries.</p><h4>Quick Build</h4><p>You can make a warlock quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the charlatan background. Third, choose the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/eldritch-blast\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"eldritch blast\">eldritch blast</a> and <a

href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Religion\">Religion</a></p><h4>Equipment</h4><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) any simple weapon</li>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a component pouch or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) an arcane focus</li>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a scholar’s pack or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack</li>\n<li>Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers</li>\n</ul><h3>Otherworldly Patron</h3><p>At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p><h3>Pact Magic</h3><p>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. See <a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting\">chapter 10</a> for the general rules of spellcasting and <a title=\"Spells\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spells\">chapter 11</a> for the warlock&nbsp;spell list.</p><h4>Cantrips</h4><p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.</p><h4>Spell Slots</h4><p>The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/witch-bolt\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"witch bolt\">witch bolt</a>, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p><h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4><p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4><p>You can use an arcane focus (see chapter 5, “<a title=\"Arcane Focus\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Equip­ment</a>”) as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</p><h3>Eldritch Invocations</h3><p>In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.&nbsp;A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p><p>At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.</p><h3>Pact Boon</h3><p>At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.</p><h4>Pact of the Chain</h4><p>You learn the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/find-familiar\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"find familiar\">find familiar</a> spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.</p><p>When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/imp\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"imp\">imp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/pseudodragon\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"pseudodragon\">pseudodragon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/quasit\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"quasit\">quasit</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/sprite\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"sprite\">sprite</a>.</p><p>Additionally, when you take the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\">Attack</a> action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack with its reaction.</p><h4>Pact of the Blade</h4><p>You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see <a title=\"Weapons\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#Weapons\">chapter 5</a> for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><p>Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.</p><p>You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.</p><h4>Pact of the Tome</h4><p>Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.</p><p>If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.</p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h3>Mystic Arcanum</h3><p>At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.</p><p>You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p><p>At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Eldritch Master</h3><p>At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>YOUR PACT BOON</strong></p>\n<p>Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron’s nature.</p>\n<p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Pact of the Chain. </span>Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One’s nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.</p>\n<p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Pact of the Blade. </span>If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.</p>\n<p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Pact of the Tome.</span> Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.</p>\n</blockquote><h2>Otherworldly Patrons</h2><p>The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence — not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.</p><p>Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.</p><h3>The Archfey</h3><p>Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born. This being’s motivations are often inscrutable, and sometimes whimsical, and might involve a striving for greater magical power or the settling of age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam, the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.</p><h4>Expanded Spell List</h4><p>The Archfey lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell.

As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h4>Misty Escape</h4><p>Starting at 6th level, you can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible\">invisible</a> and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible\">invisible</a> until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h4>Beguiling Defenses</h4><p>Beginning at 10th level, your patron teaches you how to turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them. You are immune to being <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a>, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature.

As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, it is <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.</p><p>Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion.</p><p>You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.</p><h3>The Fiend</h3><p>You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.</p><h4>Expanded Spell List</h4><p>The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell.

You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.</p><h4>Hurl Through Hell</h4><p>Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.</p><p>At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>The Great Old One</h3><p>Your patron is a mysterious entity whose nature is utterly foreign to the fabric of reality. It might come from the Far Realm, the space beyond reality, or it could be one of the elder gods known only in legends. Its motives are incomprehensible to mortals, and its knowledge so immense and ancient that even the greatest libraries pale in comparison to the vast secrets it holds. The Great Old One might be unaware of your existence or entirely indifferent to you, but the secrets you have learned allow you to draw your magic from it.</p><p>Entities of this type include Ghaunadar, called That Which Lurks; Tharizdun, the Chained God; Dendar, the Night Serpent; Zargon, the Returner; Great Cthulhu; and other unfathomable beings.</p><h4>Expanded Spell List</h4><p>The Great Old One lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell.

You don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.</p><h4>Entropic Ward</h4><p>At 6th level, you learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to turn an enemy’s failed strike into good luck for yourself. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h4>Thought Shield</h4><p>Starting at 10th level, your thoughts can’t be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you do.</p><h4>Create Thrall</h4><p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid’s mind with the alien magic of your patron. You can use your action to touch an <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a> humanoid.

Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.</p><p>Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond.</p><p>Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left.</p><p>Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.</p><h3>Scholars of the Arcane</h3><p>Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.</p><p>Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.</p><h3>The Lure of Knowledge</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/718/c3wizard1.png\"></p><p>Wizards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.</p><p>But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.</p><h3>Creating a Wizard</h3><p>Creating a wizard character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic?</p><p>What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard? Perhaps you’re simply eager to put your newfound magical skills to the test in the face of danger.</p><h4>Quick Build</h4><p>You can make a wizard quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. If you plan to join the School of Enchantment, make Charisma your next-best score. Second, choose the sage background. Third, choose the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mage-hand\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"mage hand\">mage hand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/light\"

href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Religion\">Religion</a></p><h4>Equipment</h4><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a quarterstaff or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) a dagger</li>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a component pouch or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) an arcane focus</li>\n<li>(<span class=\"italic\">a</span>) a scholar’s pack or (<span class=\"italic\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li>A spellbook</li>\n</ul><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See <a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting\">chapter 10</a> for the general rules of spellcasting and <a title=\"Spells\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spells\">chapter 11</a> for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p><h4>Cantrips</h4><p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p><h4>Spellbook</h4><p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p><h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4><p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"magic missile\">magic missile</a>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4><p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><h4>Ritual Casting</h4><p>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p><h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4><p>You can use an arcane focus (see chapter 5, “<a title=\"Arcane Focus\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Equip­ment</a>”) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p><h4>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h4><p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\n<p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n</blockquote><h3>Arcane Recovery</h3><p>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p><p>For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p><h3>Arcane Tradition</h3><p>When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.</p><p>Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h3>Spell Mastery</h3><p>At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p><p>By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p><h3>Signature Spells</h3><p>When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p><h2>Arcane Traditions</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/719/c3wizard2.png\"></p><p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in the worlds of D&amp;D, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p><p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools, as described in <a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting\">chapter 10</a>. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p><h3>School of Abjuration</h3><p>The School of Abjuration emphasizes magic that blocks, banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud and respected vocation.</p><p>Called abjurers, members of this school are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be closed.</p><h4>Abjuration Savant</h4><p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an abjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.</p><h4>Arcane Ward</h4><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has a hit point maximum equal to twice your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.</p><p>While the ward has 0 hit points, it can’t absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.</p><p>Once you create the ward, you can’t create it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h4>Projected Ward</h4><p>Starting at 6th level, when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage.</p><h4>Improved Abjuration</h4><p>Beginning at 10th level, when you cast an abjuration spell that requires you to make an ability check as a part of casting that spell (as in <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/counterspell\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"counterspell\">counterspell</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dispel magic\">dispel magic</a>), you add your proficiency bonus to that ability check.</p><h4>Spell Resistance</h4><p>Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells.</p><p>Furthermore, you have resistance against the damage of spells.</p><h3>School of Conjuration</h3><p>As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects and creatures out of thin air. You can conjure billowing clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other planes of existence, in an instant.</p><h4>Conjuration Savant</h4><p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.</p><h4>Minor Conjuration</h4><p>Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. This object can be no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light out to 5 feet.</p><p>The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again, or if it takes or deals any damage.</p><h4>Benign Transposition</h4><p>Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell of 1st level or higher.</p><h4>Focused Conjuration</h4><p>Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on a conjuration spell, your concentration can’t be broken as a result of taking damage.</p><h4>Durable Summons</h4><p>Starting at 14th level, any creature that you summon or create with a conjuration spell has 30 temporary hit points.</p><h3>School of Divination</h3><p>The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and commoners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.</p><h4>Divination Savant</h4><p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a divination spell into your spellbook is halved.</p><h4>Portent</h4><p>Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.</p><p>Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.</p><h4>Expert Divination</h4><p>Beginning at 6th level, casting divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell you cast and can’t be higher than 5th level.</p><h4>The Third Eye</h4><p>Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to increase your powers of perception. When you do so, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you are <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a> or you take a short or long rest. You can’t use the feature again until you finish a rest.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Darkvision.</span> You gain <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision\">darkvision</a> out to a range of 60 feet, as described in chapter 8, “<a title=\"Darkvision\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring#Darkvision\">Adventuring</a>.”</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Ethereal Sight.</span> You can see into the Ethereal Plane within 60 feet of you.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Greater Comprehension. </span>You can read any language.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">See Invisibility.</span> You can see <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible\">invisible</a> creatures and objects within 10 feet of you that are within line of sight.</p><h4>Greater Portent</h4><p>Starting at 14th level, the visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. You roll three d20s for your Portent feature, rather than two.</p><h3>School of Enchantment</h3><p>As a member of the School of Enchantment, you have honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile other people and monsters. Some enchanters are peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most enchanters fall somewhere in between.</p><h4>Enchantment Savant</h4><p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an enchantment spell into your spellbook is halved.</p><h4>Hypnotic Gaze</h4><p>Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature. As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or be <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a> by you until the end of your next turn. The <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a> creature’s speed drops to 0, and the creature is <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a> and visibly dazed.</p><p>On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage.</p><p>Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can’t use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.</p><h4>Instinctive Charm</h4><p>Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack, provided that another creature is within the attack’s range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. On a successful save, you can’t use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>You must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can’t be <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a> are immune to this effect.</p><h4>Split Enchantment</h4><p>Starting at 10th level, when you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher that targets only one creature, you can have it target a second creature.</p><h4>Alter Memories</h4><p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast an enchantment spell to charm one or more creatures, you can alter one creature’s understanding so that it remains unaware of being <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a>.</p><p>Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use your action to try to make the chosen creature forget some of the time it spent <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a>. The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less time, and the amount of time can’t exceed the duration of your enchantment spell.</p><h3>School of Evocation</h3><p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p><h4>Evocation Savant</h4><p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.</p><h4>Sculpt Spells</h4><p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.</p><h4>Potent Cantrip</h4><p>Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.</p><h4>Empowered Evocation</h4><p>Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.</p><h4>Overchannel</h4><p>Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.</p><p>The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.</p><h3>School of Illusion</h3><p>You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some illusionists — including many gnome wizards — are benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.</p><h4>Illusion Savant</h4><p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an illusion spell into your spellbook is halved.</p><h4>Improved Minor Illusion</h4><p>When you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/minor-illusion\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"minor illusion\">minor illusion</a> cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known.</p><p>When you cast <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/minor-illusion\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"minor illusion\">minor illusion</a>, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.</p><h4>Malleable Illusions</h4><p>Starting at 6th level, when you cast an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your action to change the nature of that illusion (using the spell’s normal parameters for the illusion), provided that you can see the illusion.</p><h4>Illusory Self</h4><p>Beginning at 10th level, you can create an illusory duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual reaction to danger. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose the illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h4>Illusory Reality</h4><p>By 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semi-reality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.</p><p>The object can’t deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.</p><h3>School of Necromancy</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/720/c3wizard3.png\"></p><p>The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all living things. As you progress, you learn to sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys its body, transforming that vital energy into magical power you can manipulate.</p><p>Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.</p><h4>Necromancy Savant</h4><p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved.</p><h4>Grim Harvest</h4><p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell’s level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the School of Necromancy. You don’t gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead.</p><h4>Undead Thralls</h4><p>At 6th level, you add the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/animate-dead\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"animate dead\">animate dead</a> spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/animate-dead\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"animate dead\">animate dead</a>, you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as appropriate.</p><p>Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has additional benefits:</p><ul>\n<li>The creature’s hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your wizard level.</li>\n<li>The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls.</li>\n</ul><h4>Inured to Undeath</h4><p>Beginning at 10th level, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum can’t be reduced. You have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of their worst effects.</p><h4>Command Undead</h4><p>Starting at 14th level, you can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by other wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can’t use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.</p><p>Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.</p><h3>School of Transmutation</h3><p>You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on reality’s forge.</p><p>Some transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, turning people into toads and transforming copper into silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the power of the gods to make and destroy worlds.</p><h4>Transmutation Savant</h4><p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation spell into your spellbook is halved.</p><h4>Minor Alchemy</h4><p>Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. You perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.</p><h4>Transmuter’s Stone</h4><p>Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter’s stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice as long as the stone is in the creature’s possession. When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options:</p><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision\">Darkvision</a> out to a range of 60 feet, as described in chapter 8, “<a title=\"Darkvision\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring#Darkvision\">Adventuring</a>”</li>\n<li>An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered</li>\n<li>Proficiency in Constitution saving throws</li>\n<li>Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit)</li>\n</ul><p>Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person.</p><p>If you create a new transmuter’s stone, the previous one ceases to function.</p><h4>Shapechanger</h4><p>At 10th level, you add the <span class=\"italic\">polymorph</span> spell to your spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/polymorph\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"polymorph\">polymorph</a> without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a beast whose challenge rating is 1 or lower.</p><p>Once you cast <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/polymorph\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"polymorph\">polymorph</a> in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.</p><h4>Master Transmuter</h4><p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter’s stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter’s stone is destroyed and can’t be remade until you finish a long rest.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Major Transformation. </span>You can transmute one nonmagical object — no larger than a 5-foot cube — into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Panacea. </span>You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter’s stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Restore Life. </span>You cast the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/raise-dead\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"raise dead\">raise dead</a> spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter’s stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.</p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Restore Youth.</span> You touch the transmuter’s stone to a willing creature, and that creature’s apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn’t extend the creature’s lifespan.</p>","img":null}

{"_id":"zxqUUs3GEwhdyluH","name":"07 Chapter 6: Customization Options","permission":{"default":0,"DJNYgTCLxATVgLjS":3},"folder":"","flags":{"vtta":{"name":"07 Chapter 6: Customization Options","sceneId":null}},"content":"<h1>Chapter 6: Customization Options</h1><p>The combination of ability scores, race, class, and background defines your character’s capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and race, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But this chapter is for&nbsp;players who — with the DM’s permission — want to go a step further.</p><p>This chapter defines two optional sets of rules for customizing your character: multiclassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you combine classes together, and feats are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels. Your DM decides whether these options are available in a campaign.</p><h2>Multiclassing</h2><p>Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.</p><p>With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you're a 5th-level character.</p><p>As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.</p><div><table id=\"multiclassingminimum\" class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"multiclassingclass\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Class</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Ability Score Minimum</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Barbarian</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Strength 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Bard</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Charisma 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Cleric</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wisdom 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Druid</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wisdom 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Fighter</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Strength 13 or Dexterity 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Monk</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Paladin</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Strength 13 and Charisma 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Ranger</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Rogue</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Dexterity 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Sorcerer</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Charisma 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Warlock</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Charisma 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wizard</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Intelligence 13</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h3>Experience Points</h3><p>The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in <a title=\"Character Advancement\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/step-by-step-characters#CharacterAdvancement\">chapter 1</a>, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric.</p><h3>Hit Points and Hit Dice</h3><p>You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.</p><p>You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.</p><h3>Proficiency Bonus</h3><p>Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in <a title=\"Character Advancement\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/step-by-step-characters#CharacterAdvancement\">chapter 1</a>, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><p>When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>MULTICLASSING EXAMPLE</strong></p>\n<p>Gary is playing a 4th-level fighter. When his character earns enough experience points to reach 5th level, Gary decides that his character will multiclass instead of continuing to progress as a fighter. Gary’s fighter has been spending a lot of time with Dave’s rogue, and has even been doing some jobs on the side for the local thieves’ guild as a bruiser. Gary decides that his character will multiclass into the rogue class, and thus his character becomes a 4th-level fighter and 1st-level rogue (written as fighter 4/rogue 1).</p>\n<p>When Gary’s character earns enough experience to reach 6th level, he can decide whether to add another fighter level (becoming a fighter 5/rogue 1), another rogue level (becoming a fighter 4/rogue 2), or a level in a third class, perhaps dabbling in wizardry thanks to the tome of mysterious lore he acquired (becoming a fighter 4/rogue 1/wizard 1).</p>\n</blockquote><h4>Multiclassing Proficiencies</h4><div><table id=\"multiclassingproficiencies\" class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"multiclassingproficienciesclass\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Class</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Proficiencies Gained</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Barbarian</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Bard</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Cleric</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Light armor, medium armor, shields</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Druid</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Fighter</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Monk</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Simple weapons, shortswords</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Paladin</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Ranger</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class's skill list</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Rogue</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Light armor, one skill from the class's skill list, thieves' tools</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Sorcerer</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Warlock</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Light armor, simple weapons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wizard</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h2>Class Features</h2><p>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.</p><h4>Channel Divinity</h4><p>If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.</p><h4>Extra Attack</h4><p>If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.</p><h4>Unarmored Defense</h4><p>If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.</p><h2>Spellcasting</h2><p>Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.</p><p><strong>Spells Known and Prepared.</strong> You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.</p><p>Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.</p><p>If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.</p><p>If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/burning-hands\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"burning hands\">burning hands</a>, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.</p><p>For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know — and potentially enhance their effects.</p><p><strong>Pact Magic.</strong> If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.</p><h4>Multiclass Spellcaster</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1682143203\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[xJtuYG9ljptRJ2I3]{Level: 1st}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1682143202\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[LPtAd9UIzawhmVmX]{Level: 2nd}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1682143201\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[56E2fN5ZcH5jvQEh]{Level: 3rd}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1682143200\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[c22ZyOwcPNUw1Mwj]{Level: 4th}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1682143199\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[37mY4G9YoJIitqPP]{Level: 5th}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1682143198\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[5KIrMcfUbtqWIoBt]{Level: 6th}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1682143197\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[QRDRUpkMrcbItK38]{Level: 7th}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1682143196\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[Oxa7joFolYhxVMCR]{Level: 8th}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1682143195\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[FA8f0piJ5CtlfA3B]{Level: 9th}</span></div></div></div><h2>Feats</h2><p>A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities.

If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher.

Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a race (such as human or halfling) and a class (such as fighter or wizard). You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons world.</p><p>Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a courageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a flamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar. Do you like fantasy fiction featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of one of those races. Do you want your character to be the toughest adventurer at the table? Consider the fighter class. If you don’t know where else to begin, take a look at the illustrations in any Dungeons &amp; Dragons book to see what catches your interest.</p><p>Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. Your conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What’s important is that you come to the table with a character you’re excited to play.</p><p>Throughout this chapter, we use the term <b>character sheet</b> to mean whatever you use to track your character, whether it’s a formal character sheet (like the one at the end of these rules), some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper. An official D&amp;D character sheet is a fine place to start until you know what information you need and how you use it during the game.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>BUILDING BRUENOR</strong></p>\n<p>Each step of character creation includes an example of that step, with a player named Bob building his dwarf character, Bruenor.</p>\n</blockquote><h2>1. Choose a Race</h2><div>\n<p>Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the D&amp;D world. The most common player character races are dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. Some races also have <b>subraces</b>, such as mountain dwarf or wood elf, as well as the less widespread races of dragonborn, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, and tieflings. <a title=\"Races\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/races\">Chapter 2</a>&nbsp;provides more information about these races.</p>\n<p>The race you choose contributes to your character’s identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be powerful wizards. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too. Halfling paladins and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.</p>\n<p>Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and remember to apply them later.</p>\n<p>Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet. Be sure to note your starting languages and your base speed as well.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"compendium-first-line-blockquote\">\n<p><strong>BUILDING BRUENOR, STEP 1</strong></p>\n<p>Bob is sitting down to create his character.

Choose a Class</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/609/ch1bruenor.png\"></p><div>\n<p>Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in chapter 3, \"<a title=\"Classes\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/classes\">Classes</a>.\"</p>\n<p>Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are <b>class features&nbsp;</b>— capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of <b>proficiencies</b>: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.</p>\n<p>On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Level\">Level</h3>\n<p>Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining <b>experience points</b> (XP). A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.</p>\n<p>Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar with the game, or if you are joining an existing D&amp;D campaign, your DM might decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing adventures.</p>\n<p>Record your level on your character sheet. If you’re starting at a higher level, record the additional elements your class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also record your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0 XP. A higher-level character typically begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level (see “<a title=\"Beyond 1st Level\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/step-by-step-characters#Beyond1stLevel\">Beyond 1st Level</a>” later in this chapter).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>QUICK BUILD</strong></p>\n<p>Each class description in <a title=\"Classes\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/classes\">chapter 3</a>&nbsp;includes a section offering suggestions to quickly build a character of that class, including how to assign your highest ability scores, a background suitable to the class, and starting spells.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"HitPointsandHitDice\">Hit Points and Hit Dice</h3>\n<p>Your character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).</p>\n<p>At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your <b>hit point maximum</b>.</p>\n<p>Record your character’s hit points on your character sheet. Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see “<a title=\"Resting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring#Resting\">Resting</a>” in chapter 8, \"<a title=\"Adventuring\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring\">Adventuring</a>\").</p>\n<h3 id=\"ProficiencyBonus\">Proficiency Bonus</h3>\n<p>The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attack rolls using weapons you’re proficient with</li>\n<li>Attack rolls with spells you cast</li>\n<li>Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in</li>\n<li>Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with</li>\n<li>Saving throws you’re proficient in</li>\n<li>Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting class)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in chapter 7, \"<a title=\"Using Ability Scores\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/using-ability-scores\">Using Ability Scores</a>\", and tools in chapter 5, \"<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#Tools\">Equipment</a>.\") Your background gives you additional skill and tool proficiencies, and some races give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.</p>\n<p>Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"compendium-first-line-blockquote\">\n<p><strong>BUILDING BRUENOR, STEP 2</strong></p>\n<p>Bob imagines Bruenor charging into battle with an axe, one horn on his helmet broken off. He makes Bruenor a fighter and notes the fighter’s proficiencies and 1st-level class features on his character sheet.</p>\n<p>As a 1st-level fighter, Bruenor has 1 Hit Die—a d10—and starts with hit points equal to 10 + his Constitution modifier. Bob notes this, and will record the final number after he determines Bruenor’s Constitution score (see step 3). Bob also notes the proficiency bonus for a 1st-level character, which is +2.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><h2>3. Determine Ability Scores</h2><div>\n<p>Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: <b>Strength</b>, <b>Dexterity</b>, <b>Constitution</b>, <b>Intelligence</b>, <b>Wisdom</b>, and <b>Charisma</b>. Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.</p>\n<p>The six abilities and their use in the game are described in <a title=\"Using Ability Scores\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/using-ability-scores\">chapter 7</a>. The Ability Score Summary table provides a quick reference for what qualities are measured by each ability, what races increases which abilities, and what classes consider each ability particularly important.</p>\n<p>You generate your character’s six <b>ability scores</b> randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to save time or don’t like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.</p>\n<p>Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character’s six abilities to assign scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores as a result of your race choice.</p>\n<p>After assigning your ability scores, determine your <b>ability modifiers</b> using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"compendium-first-line-blockquote\">\n<p><strong>BUILDING BRUENOR, STEP 3</strong></p>\n<p>Bob decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for Bruenor’s abilities. Since he’s a fighter, he puts his highest score, 15, in Strength. His next-highest, 14, goes in Constitution. Bruenor might be a brash fighter, but Bob decides he wants the dwarf to be older, wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent scores in Wisdom and Charisma. After applying his racial benefits (increasing Bruenor’s Constitution by 2 and his Strength by 2), Bruenor’s ability scores and modifiers look like this: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (–1), Wisdom 13 (+1), Charisma 12 (+1).</p>\n<p>Bob fills in Bruenor’s final hit points: 10 + his Constitution modifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit points.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"VariantCustomizingAbilityScores\">Variant: Customizing Ability Scores</h3>\n<p>At your Dungeon Master’s option, you can use this variant for determining your ability scores. The method described here allows you to build a character with a set of ability scores you choose individually.</p>\n<p>You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying racial increases. You can’t have a score lower than 8.</p>\n<p>This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of numbers between those extremes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"AbilityScorePointCost\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Ability Score Point Cost</h4>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\"><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"731322389\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[SoBB7Vxaixg4Us5x]{Cost}</span></div></div></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"AbilityScoreSummary\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Ability Score Summary</h4>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Strength</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top;

Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or she behaves in general terms.</p>\n<p>Using the information in the chapter 4 \"<a title=\"Personality and Background\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/personality-and-background\">Personality and Background</a>,\" you can flesh out your character’s physical appearance and personality traits. Choose your character’s <b>alignment</b> (the moral compass that guides his or her decisions) and <b>ideals</b>. <a title=\"Personality and Background\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/personality-and-background\">Chapter 4</a>&nbsp;also helps you identify the things your character holds most dear, called <b>bonds</b>, and the <b>flaws</b> that could one day undermine him or her.</p>\n<p>Your character’s <b>background</b> describes where he or she came from, his or her original occupation, and the character’s place in the D&amp;D world. Your DM might offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included in <a title=\"Personality and Background\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/personality-and-background\">chapter 4</a>, and might be willing to work with you to craft a background that’s a more precise fit for your character concept.</p>\n<p>A background gives your character a background feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, and it might also give you additional languages or proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this information, along with the personality information you develop, on your character sheet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"YourCharactersAbilities\">Your Character's Abilities</h3>\n<p>Take your character’s ability scores and race into account as you flesh out his or her appearance and personality. A very strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart character with low Strength.</p>\n<p>For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might be scrawny or plump.</p>\n<p>A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.</p>\n<p>A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low Constitution might be sickly or frail.</p>\n<p>A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.</p>\n<p>A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on. A character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.</p>\n<p>A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A character with a low Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"compendium-first-line-blockquote\">\n<p><strong>BUILDING BRUENOR, STEP 4</strong></p>\n<p>Bob fills in some of Bruenor’s basic details: his name, his sex (male), his height and weight, and his alignment (lawful good). His high Strength and Constitution suggest a healthy, athletic body, and his low Intelligence suggests a degree of forgetfulness.</p>\n<p>Bob decides that Bruenor comes from a noble line, but his clan was expelled from its homeland when Bruenor was very young. He grew up working as a smith in the remote villages of Icewind Dale. But Bruenor has a heroic destiny—to reclaim his homeland—so Bob chooses the folk hero background for his dwarf. He notes the proficiencies and special feature this background gives him.</p>\n<p>Bob has a pretty clear picture of Bruenor’s personality in mind, so he skips the personality traits suggested in the folk hero background, noting instead that Bruenor is a caring, sensitive dwarf who genuinely loves his friends and allies, but he hides this soft heart behind a gruff, snarling demeanor. He chooses the ideal of fairness from the list in his background, noting that Bruenor believes that no one is above the law.</p>\n<p>Given his history, Bruenor’s bond is obvious: he aspires to someday reclaim Mithral Hall, his homeland, from the shadow dragon that drove the dwarves out. His flaw is tied to his caring, sensitive nature—he has a soft spot for orphans and wayward souls, leading him to show mercy even when it might not be warranted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><h2>5. Choose Equipment</h2><div>\n<p>Your class and background determine your character’s <b>starting equipment</b>, including weapons, armor, and other adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your character sheet. All such items are detailed in chapter 5 \"<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>.\"</p>\n<p>Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase your starting equipment. You have a number of <b>gold pieces</b> (gp) to spend based on your class, as shown in <a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment\">chapter 5</a>. Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in that chapter. If you wish, you can also have one trinket at no cost (see the \"<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#Trinkets\">Trinkets</a>\" table at the end of <a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment\">chapter 5</a>).</p>\n<p>Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry.

Things that contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters wear armor or carry shields, however.</p>\n<p>Without armor or a shield, your character’s AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your AC using the rules in <a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment\">chapter 5</a>. Record your AC on your character sheet.</p>\n<p>Your character needs to be proficient with armor and shields to wear and use them effectively, and your armor and shield proficiencies are determined by your class. There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in <a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment\">chapter 5</a>.</p>\n<p>Some spells and class features give you a different way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features that give you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose which one to use.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Weapons\">Weapons</h3>\n<p>For each weapon your character wields, calculate the modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and the damage you deal when you hit.</p>\n<p>When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For attacks with <b>melee weapons</b>, use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the finesse property, such as a rapier, can use your Dexterity modifier instead.</li>\n<li>For attacks with <b>ranged weapons</b>, use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls. A melee weapon that has the thrown property, such as a handaxe, can use your Strength modifier instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"compendium-first-line-blockquote\">\n<p><strong>BUILDING BRUENOR, STEP 5</strong></p>\n<p>Bob writes down the starting equipment from the fighter class and the folk hero background. His starting equipment includes chain mail and a shield, which combine to give Bruenor an Armor Class of 18.</p>\n<p>For Bruenor’s weapons, Bob chooses a battleaxe and two handaxes. His battleaxe is a melee weapon, so Bruenor uses his Strength modifier for his attacks and damage. His attack bonus is his Strength modifier (+3) plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5. The battleaxe deals 1d8 slashing damage, and Bruenor adds his Strength modifier to the damage when he hits, for a total of 1d8 + 3 slashing damage. When throwing a handaxe, Bruenor has the same attack bonus (handaxes, as thrown weapons, use Strength for attacks and damage), and the weapon deals 1d6 + 3 slashing damage when it hits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><h2>6. Come Together</h2><div>\n<p>Most D&amp;D characters don’t work alone. Each character plays a role within a <b>party</b>, a group of adventurers working together for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party’s chances to survive the many perils in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Talk to your fellow players and your DM to decide whether your characters know one another, how they met, and what sorts of quests the group might undertake.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/3/290/c0-03.png\"></p>\n</div><h2>Beyond 1st Level</h2><p>As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called <strong>gaining a level</strong>.</p><h3>Class Features and Hit Dice</h3><p>When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.</p><p>Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).</p><p>When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level fighter has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.</p><h3>XP and Proficiency Bonus&nbsp;Progression</h3><p>The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your character's class description to see what other improvements you gain at each level.</p><h3>Tiers of Play</h3><p>The shading in the Character Advancement table shows the four tiers of play. The tiers don’t have any rules associated with them; they are a general description of how the play experience changes as characters gain levels.</p><p>In the <strong>first tier</strong> (levels 1–4), characters are effectively apprentice adventurers. They are learning the features that define them as members of particular classes, including the major choices that flavor their class features as they advance (such as a wizard’s Arcane Tradition or a fighter’s Martial Archetype). The threats they face are relatively minor, usually posing a danger to local farmsteads or villages.</p><p>In the <strong>second tier</strong> (levels 5–10), characters come into their own. Many spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level spells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold of magical power with spells such as <span class=\"italic\">fireball</span> and <span class=\"italic\">lightning bolt</span>. At this tier, many weapon-using classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in one round. These characters have become important, facing dangers that threaten cities and kingdoms.</p><p>In the <strong>third tier</strong> (levels 11–16), characters have reached a level of power that sets them high above the ordinary populace and makes them special even among adventurers. At 11th level, many spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells, some of which create effects previously impossible for player characters to achieve. Other characters gain features that allow them to make more attacks or do more impressive things with those attacks. These mighty adventurers often confront threats to whole regions and continents.</p><p>At the <strong>fourth tier</strong> (levels 17–20), characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic (or villainous) archetypes in their own right. The fate of the world or even the fundamental order of the multiverse might hang in the balance during their adventures.</p><h4>Character Advancement</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1213629579\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[85D737JAMdDf7s1m]{Experience Points: Experience Points}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1213629580\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[hhvENBqf8zz468CI]{Experience Points: Level}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1213629581\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[yhynMcJOF0nzR8zd]{Experience Points: Proficiency Bonus}</span></div></div></div>","img":null}

Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.</p><div><table class=\"compendium-gear-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Lifestyle</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">Price/Day</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wretched</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Squalid</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">1 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Poor</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">2 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Modest</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">1 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Comfortable</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">2 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wealthy</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">4 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Aristocratic</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">10 gp minimum</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p><strong>Wretched.</strong> You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.</p><p><strong>Squalid.</strong> You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.</p><p><strong>Poor.</strong> A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.</p><p><strong>Modest.</strong> A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.</p><p><strong>Comfortable.</strong> Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.</p><p><strong>Wealthy.</strong> Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.</p><p><strong>Aristocratic.</strong> You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>SELF SUFFICIENCY</strong></p>\n<p>The expenses and lifestyles described in this chapter assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford — paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.</p>\n<p>Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession as described in <a title=\"Practicing a Profession\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring#PracticingaProfession\">chapter 8</a>, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival\">Survival</a> skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.</p>\n</blockquote><h3>Food, Drink, and Lodging</h3><p>The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food items and a single night's lodging. These prices are included in your total lifestyle expenses.</p><p><strong>Food and Drink</strong></p><div><table id=\"expensesfooddrink\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Item</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">Cost</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Ale (gallon)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">2 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Ale (mug)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">4 cp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Banquet (per person)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">10 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Bread, loaf</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">2 cp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Cheese, hunk</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">1 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Meat, chunk</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">3 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wine, common (pitcher)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">2 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wine, fine (bottle)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">10 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p><strong>Meals and Lodging (per day)</strong></p><div><table class=\"compendium-gear-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Item</th>\n<th class=\"gear-cost\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">Meals Cost</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">Lodging Cost</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Squalid</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">3 cp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">7 cp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Poor</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">6 cp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">1 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Modest</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">3 sp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">5 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Comfortable</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">5 sp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">8 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wealthy</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">8 sp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">2 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Aristocratic</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">2 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\">4 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h3>Services</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/733/c513.png\"></p><p>Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.</p><p>Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming in front of the duke.</p><p>Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.</p><div><table class=\"expenses-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Service</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Pay</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Coach cab (Between towns)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">3 cp per mile</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Coach cab (Within a city)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 cp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Hireling (Skilled)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2 gp per day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Hireling (Untrained)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2 sp per day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Messenger</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2 cp per mile</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Road or gate toll</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 cp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Ship's passage</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 sp per mile</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p>Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.</p><h3>Spellcasting Services</h3><p>People who are able to cast spells don't fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.</p><p>Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"cure wounds\">cure wounds</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"identify\">identify</a>, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment — the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.</p></div>","img":null}

{"_id":"Zqzn6AAckd4Qduwq","name":"01 Preface","permission":{"default":0,"DJNYgTCLxATVgLjS":3},"folder":"","flags":{"vtta":{"name":"01 Preface","sceneId":null}},"content":"<h1>Preface</h1><blockquote>\n<p>Once upon a time, long, long ago, in a&nbsp;realm called the Midwestern United States — specifically the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin — a group of friends gathered together to forever alter the history of gaming.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t their intent to do so. They were tired of merely reading tales about worlds of magic, monsters, and adventure. They wanted to play in those worlds, rather than observe them. That they went on to&nbsp; invent&nbsp;Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and thereby ignite a revolution in gaming that continues to this day, speaks to two things.</p>\n<p>First, it speaks to their ingenuity and genius in figuring out that games were the perfect way to explore worlds that could not otherwise exist. Almost every modern game, whether played on a digital device or a tabletop, owes some&nbsp;debt to D&amp;D.</p>\n<p>Second, it is a testament to the inherent appeal of the game they created.&nbsp;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;sparked a thriving global phenomenon. It is the first roleplaying game, and it remains one of the best&nbsp;of its breed.</p>\n<p>To play D&amp;D, and to play it well, you don’t need to read all the rules, memorize every detail of the game, or master the fine art of rolling funny looking dice. None of those things have any bearing on what’s best about the game.</p>\n<p>What you need are two things, the first being friends with whom you can share the game. Playing games with your friends is a lot of fun, but D&amp;D does something more than entertain.</p>\n<p>Playing D&amp;D is an exercise in collaborative creation. You and your friends create epic stories filled with tension and memorable drama. You create silly in-jokes that make you laugh years later. The dice will be cruel to you, but you will soldier on. Your collective creativity will build stories that you will tell again and again, ranging from the utterly absurd to the stuff of legend.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have friends interested in playing, don’t worry. There’s a special alchemy that takes place around a D&amp;D table that nothing else can match. Play the game with someone enough, and the two of you are likely to end up friends. It’s a cool side effect of the game. Your next gaming group is as close as the nearest game store, online forum, or gaming convention.</p>\n<p>The second thing you need is a lively imagination or, more importantly, the willingness to use whatever imagination you have. You don’t need to be a master storyteller or a brilliant artist. You just need to aspire to create, to have the courage of someone who is willing to build something and share it&nbsp;with others.</p>\n<p>Luckily, just as D&amp;D can strengthen your friendships, it can help build in you the confidence to create and share. D&amp;D is a game that teaches you to look for the clever solution, share the sudden idea that can overcome a problem, and push yourself to imagine what could be, rather than simply accept what is.</p>\n<p>The first characters and adventures you create will probably be a collection of clichés. That’s true of everyone, from the greatest Dungeon Masters in history on down. Accept this reality and move on to create the second character or adventure, which will be better, and then the third, which will be better still. Repeat that over the course of time, and soon you’ll be able to create anything, from a character’s background story to an epic world of fantasy adventure.</p>\n<p>Once you have that skill, it’s yours forever. Countless writers, artists, and other creators can trace their beginnings to a few pages of D&amp;D notes, a handful of dice, and a kitchen table.</p>\n<p>Above all else, D&amp;D is yours. The friendships you make around the table will be unique to you. The adventures you embark on, the characters you create, the memories you make—these will be yours. D&amp;D is your personal corner of the universe, a place where you have free reign to do&nbsp;as you wish.</p>\n<p>Go forth now. Read the rules of the game and the story of its worlds, but always remember that you are the one who brings them to life. They are nothing without the spark of life that you give them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Mike Mearls<br>May 2014</p>\n</blockquote><h1>Introduction</h1><p>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games, D&amp;D is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents.</p><div>\n<blockquote class=\"adventure-read-aloud-text\">\n<p><strong>Dungeon Master (DM):</strong> After passing through the craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east and Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling towers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach. They look like abandoned guardhouses. Beyond these, a wide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep fog below. A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm, leading to an arched entrance to the castle courtyard. The chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind, their rust-eaten iron straining with the weight. From atop the high strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you from hollow sockets and grin hideously. A rotting wooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs in the entry tunnel. Beyond this, the main doors of Castle Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into the courtyard.</p>\n<p><strong>Phillip (playing Gareth):</strong> I want to look at the gargoyles. I have a feeling they’re not just statues.</p>\n<p><strong>Amy (playing Riva):</strong> The drawbridge looks precarious? I want to see how sturdy it is. Do I think we can cross it, or is it going to collapse under our weight?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><p>Unlike a game of make-believe, D&amp;D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers’ action. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical lightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.</p><div>\n<blockquote class=\"adventure-read-aloud-text\">\n<p><strong>Dungeon Master (DM): </strong>OK, one at a time. Phillip, you’re looking at the gargoyles?</p>\n<p><strong>Phillip: </strong>Yeah. Is there any hint they might be creatures and not decorations?</p>\n<p><strong>DM:</strong> Make an Intelligence check.</p>\n<p><strong>Phillip: </strong>Does my Investigation skill apply?</p>\n<p><strong>DM: </strong>Sure!</p>\n<p><strong>Phillip (rolling a d20): </strong>Ugh. Seven.</p>\n<p><strong>DM: </strong>They look like decorations to you. And Amy, Riva is checking out the drawbridge?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><p>In the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends). Working together, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious mountain. The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover fabulous magic items and other treasure.</p><p>One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon Master (DM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The DM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM might describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do. Will they walk across the dangerously weathered drawbridge? Tie themselves together with rope to minimize the chance that someone will fall if the drawbridge gives way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm?</p><p>Then the DM determines the results of the adventurers’ actions and narrates what they experience. Because the DM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&amp;D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.</p><p>The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a <strong>campaign</strong>. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow in might as the campaign continues. Each monster defeated, each adventure completed, and each treasure recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an adventurer’s level.</p><p>There’s no winning and losing in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood. Together, the DM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, or the player might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.</p><h2>Worlds of Adventure</h2><p>The many worlds of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game are places of magic and monsters, of brave warriors and spectacular adventures. They begin with a foundation of medieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places, and magic that make these worlds unique.</p><p>The worlds of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game exist within a vast cosmos called the <strong>multiverse</strong>, connected in strange and mysterious ways to one another and to other planes of existence, such as the Elemental Plane of Fire and the Infinite Depths of the Abyss. Within this multiverse are an endless variety of worlds. Many of them have been published as official settings for the D&amp;D game. The legends of the Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron settings are woven together in the fabric of the multiverse. Alongside these worlds are hundreds of thousands more, created by generations of D&amp;D players for their own games. And amid all the richness of the multiverse, you might create a world of your own.</p><p>All these worlds share characteristics, but each world is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive monsters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dungeons, and scheming villains. Some races have unusual traits in different worlds. The halflings of the Dark Sun setting, for example, are jungle-dwelling cannibals, and the elves are desert nomads. Some worlds feature races unknown in other settings, such as Eberron’s warforged, soldiers created and imbued with life to fight in the Last War. Some worlds are dominated by one great story, like the War of the Lance that plays a central role in the Dragonlance setting. But they’re all D&amp;D worlds, and you can use the rules here to create a character and play in any one of them.</p><p>Your DM might set the campaign on one of these worlds or on one that he or she created. Because there is so much diversity among the worlds of D&amp;D, you should check with your DM about any house rules that will affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Dungeon Master is the authority on the campaign and its setting, even if the setting is a published world.</p><h2>Using This Book</h2><div>\n<p>The <em>Player's Handbook</em>&nbsp;is&nbsp;divided into three parts.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Part 1</span></strong> (chapters 1–6) is about creating a character, providing the rules and guidance you need to make the character you’ll play in the game. It includes information on the various races, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and other customization options that you can choose from. Many of the rules in part 1 rely on material in parts 2 and 3. If you come across a game concept in part 1 that you don’t understand, consult the book’s index.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Part 2</span></strong> (chapters 7–9) details the rules of how to play the game, beyond the basics described in this introduction. That part covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine success or failure at the tasks your character attempts, and describes the three broad categories of activity in the game: exploration, interaction, and combat.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Part 3</span></strong> (chapters 10–11) is all about magic. It covers the nature of magic in the worlds of D&amp;D, the rules for spellcasting, and the huge variety of spells available to magic-using characters (and monsters) in the game.</p>\n</div><h2>How to Play</h2><div>\n<p>The play of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game unfolds according to this basic pattern.</p>\n<p><b>1. The DM describes the environment.</b></p>\n<p>The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s around them, presenting the basic scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what’s on a table, who’s in the tavern, and so on).</p>\n<p><b>2. The players describe what they want to do.</b></p>\n<p>Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, “We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. The players don’t need to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.</p>\n<p><b>3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers’ actions.</b></p>\n<p>Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.</p>\n<p>This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured and the players (and DM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.</p>\n<p>Often the action of an adventure takes place in the imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM’s verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.</p>\n<h3 id=\"GameDice\">Game Dice</h3>\n<p>The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many bookstores.</p>\n<p>In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).</p>\n<p>Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.</p>\n<p>When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add. For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.</p>\n<p>The same d notation appears in the expressions “1d3” and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it’s a 2.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"TheD20\">The D20</h3>\n<p>Does an adventurer’s sword swing hurt a dragon or just bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball, or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.</p>\n<p>Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six <b>ability scores</b>. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the <b>ability modifiers</b> derived from them, are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or monster’s behalf.</p>\n<p>Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.</p>\n<img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/6/552/dice_1.png\">\n<p><b>1. Roll the die and add a modifier.</b></p>\n<p>Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill. (See <a title=\"Step-By-Step Characters\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/step-by-step-characters\">Chapter 1</a>&nbsp;for details on each ability and how to determine an ability’s modifier.)</p>\n<p><b>2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.</b></p>\n<p>A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.</p>\n<p><b>3. Compare the total to a target number.</b></p>\n<p>If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it’s a failure. The <b>DM</b> is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.</p>\n<p>The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a <b>Difficulty Class</b> (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an <b>Armor Class</b> (AC).</p>\n<p>This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&amp;D play. Chapter 7, \"<a title=\"Using Ability Scores\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/using-ability-scores\">Using Ability Scores</a>\" provides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the game.</p>\n<h3 id=\"AdvantageandDisadvantage\">Advantage and Disadvantage</h3>\n<p>Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p>\n<p>More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in <a title=\"Using Ability Scores\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/using-ability-scores\">chapter 7</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SpecificBeatsGeneral\">Specific Beats General</h3>\n<p>This compendium contains rules that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.</p>\n<p>Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many adventurers don’t have proficiency with longbows, but every wood elf does because of a racial trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For instance, an adventurer can’t normally pass through walls, but some spells make that possible. Magic accounts for most of the major exceptions to the rules.</p>\n<h3 id=\"RoundDown\">Round Down</h3>\n<p>There’s one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.</p>\n</div><h2>Adventures</h2><div>\n<p>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons game consists of a group of characters embarking on an adventure that the Dungeon Master presents to them. Each character brings particular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability scores and skills, class features, racial traits, equipment, and magic items. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of adventurers is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully complete the adventure.</p>\n<p>The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased off the shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the DM’s needs and desires. In either case, an adventure features a fantastic setting, whether it’s an underground dungeon, a crumbling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It features a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created and played by the other players at the table, as well as nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of an adventure’s action.</p>\n<p>Over the course of their adventures, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the adventurers and other creatures do their best to kill or capture each other in combat. At other times, the adventurers talk to another creature (or even a magical object) with a goal in mind. And often, the adventurers spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find something hidden, or unravel the current situation. Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the world, making decisions about which way to travel and what they’ll try to do next.</p>\n<p>Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges, and it might take no more than a single game session to complete. A long adventure can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other challenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end of an adventure is marked by the adventurers heading back to civilization to rest and enjoy the spoils of their labors.</p>\n<p>But that’s not the end of the story. You can think of an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made up of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series—a string of adventures joined together, with a consistent group of adventurers following the narrative from start to finish.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TheThreePillarsofAdventure\">The Three Pillars of Adventure</h3>\n<p>Adventurers can try to do anything their players can imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities in three broad categories: exploration, social interaction, and combat.</p>\n<p><b>Exploration</b> includes both the adventurers’ movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations that require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the characters spending a day crossing a rolling plain or an hour making their way through caverns underground. On the smallest scale, it could mean one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to see what happens.</p>\n<p><b>Social interaction</b> features the adventurers talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding that a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the goblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner, pleading for mercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading a talkative magic mirror to show a distant location to the adventurers.</p>\n<p>The rules in part 2 (especially \"<a title=\"Using Ability Scores\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/using-ability-scores\">Using Ability Scores</a>\"&nbsp;and \"<a title=\"Adventuring\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring\">Adventuring</a>\") support exploration and social interaction, as do many class features in \"<a title=\"Classes\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/classes\">Classes</a>\"&nbsp;and personality traits in \"<a title=\"Personality and Background\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/personality-and-background\">Personality and Background</a>.\"</p>\n<p><b>Combat</b>, the focus of <a title=\"Combat\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat\">chapter 9</a>, involves characters and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells, maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat is the most structured element of a D&amp;D session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle, there’s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to attempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs on a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by pulling a mysterious lever), and to interact with other creatures, including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TheWondersofMagic\">The Wonders of Magic</h3>\n<p>Few D&amp;D adventures end without something magical happening. Whether helpful or harmful, magic appears frequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is the focus of <a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting\">part 3</a>.</p>\n<p>In the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, practitioners of magic are rare, set apart from the masses of people by their extraordinary talent. Common folk might see evidence of magic on a regular basis, but it’s usually minor—a fantastic monster, a visibly answered prayer, a wizard walking through the streets with an animated shield guardian as a bodyguard.</p>\n<p>For adventurers, though, magic is key to their survival. Without the healing magic of clerics and paladins, adventurers would quickly succumb to their wounds. Without the uplifting magical support of bards and clerics, warriors might be overwhelmed by powerful foes. Without the sheer magical power and versatility of wizards and druids, every threat would be magnified tenfold.</p>\n<p>Magic is also a favored tool of villains. Many adventures are driven by the machinations of spellcasters who are hellbent on using magic for some ill end. A cult leader seeks to awaken a god who slumbers beneath the sea, a hag kidnaps youths to magically drain them of their vigor, a mad wizard labors to invest an army of automatons with a facsimile of life, a dragon begins a mystical ritual to rise up as a god of destruction—these are just a few of the magical threats that adventurers might face. With magic of their own, in the form of spells and magic items, the adventurers might prevail!</p>\n</div><img>","img":null}

proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>martial</strong>. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.</p><p>Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.</p><h3>Weapon Properties</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/723/c53.png\"></p><p>Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.</p><p><strong>Ammunition.</strong> You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</p><p>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see \"Improvised Weapons\" later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.</p><p><strong>Finesse.</strong> When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p><p><strong>Heavy.</strong> Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.</p><p><strong>Light.</strong> A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. See the rules for two-weapon fighting in <a title=\"Two-Weapon Fighting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat#TwoWeaponFighting\">chapter 9</a>.</p><p><strong>Loading.</strong> Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p><p><strong>Range.</strong> A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p><p><strong>Reach.</strong> This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it (see <a title=\"Opportunity Attacks\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat#OpportunityAttacks\">chapter 9</a>).</p><p><strong>Special.</strong> A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see \"Special Weapons\" later in this section).</p><p><strong>Thrown.</strong> If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</p><p><strong>Two-Handed.</strong> This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.</p><p><strong>Versatile.</strong> This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property — the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p><h3>Improvised Weapons</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/724/c54.png\"></p><p>Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.</p><p>Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.</p><p>An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p><h3>Silvered Weapons</h3><p>Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.</p><h3>Special Weapons</h3><p>Weapons with special rules are described here.</p><p><strong>Lance.</strong> You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.</p><p><strong>Net.</strong> A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained\">restrained</a> until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.</p><p>When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/725/c55.png\"></p></div>","img":null}
