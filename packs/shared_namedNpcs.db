As a young and doubting adherent of Lolth, he stumbled upon fragments of a relic known as the Black Altar, exposing him to their infinite truths and shocking the drow’s hair jet-black. His matching “beard” is actually a slow-growing colony of inert spores that K’thriss believes makes him look distinguished.
