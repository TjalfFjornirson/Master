Even if you use an existing setting, such as the Forgotten Realms, it becomes yours as you set your adventures there, create characters to inhabit it, and make changes to it over the course of your campaign. This chapter is all about building your world and then creating a campaign to take pl<span class=\"No-Break\">ace in it.</span></p><h2>The Big Picture</h2><p>This book, the <span class=\"italic\"><em><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em>,</span> and the <span class=\"italic\"><em><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/mm\">Monster Manual</a></em></span> present the default assumptions for how the worlds of D&amp;D work. Among the established settings of D&amp;D, the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Mystara don’t stray very far from those assumptions. Settings such as Dark Sun, Eberron, Ravenloft, Spelljammer, and Planescape venture further away from that baseline. As you create your own world, it’s up to you to decide where on the spectrum you want your worl<span class=\"No-Break\">d to fall.</span></p><h3>Core Assumptions</h3><p>The rules of the game are based on the following core assumptions about the g<span class=\"No-Break\">ame world.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"> Gods Oversee the World.</span></strong> The gods are real and embody a variety of beliefs, with each god claiming dominion over an aspect of the world, such as war, forests, or the sea. Gods exert influence over the world by granting divine magic to their followers and sending signs and portents to guide them. The follower of a god serves as an agent of that god in the world. The agent seeks to further the ideals of that god and defeat its rivals. While some folk might refuse to honor the gods, none can deny their <span class=\"No-Break\">existence.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"> Much of the World Is Untamed.</span></strong> Wild regions abound. City-states, confederacies, and kingdoms of various sizes dot the landscape, but beyond their borders the wilds crowd in. People know the area they live in well. They’ve heard stories of other places from merchants and travelers, but few know what lies beyond the mountains or in the depths of the great forest unless they’ve been there t<span class=\"No-Break\">hemselves.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"> The World Is Ancient.</span></strong> Empires rise and fall, leaving few places that have not been touched by imperial grandeur or decay. War, time, and natural forces eventually claim the mortal world, leaving it rich with places of adventure and mystery. Ancient civilizations and their knowledge survive in legends, magic items, and their ruins. Chaos and evil often follow an empire’s<span class=\"No-Break\"> collapse.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"> Conflict Shapes the World’s History.</span></strong> Powerful individuals strive to make their mark on the world, and factions of like-minded individuals can alter the course of history. Factions include religions led by charismatic prophets, kingdoms ruled by lasting dynasties, and shadowy societies that seek to master long-lost magic. The influence of such factions waxes and wanes as they compete with each other for power. Some seek to preserve the world and usher in a golden age. Others strive toward evil ends, seeking to rule the world with an iron fist. Still others seek goals that range from the practical to the esoteric, such as the accumulation of material wealth or the resurrection of a dead god. Whatever their goals, these factions inevitably collide, creating conflict that can steer the wor<span class=\"No-Break\">ld’s fate.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The World Is Magical</span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">.</span></strong> Practitioners of magic are relatively few in number, but they leave evidence of their craft everywhere. The magic can be as innocuous and commonplace as a potion that heals wounds to something much more rare and impressive, such as a levitating tower or a stone golem guarding the gates of a city. Beyond the realms of civilization are caches of magic items guarded by magic traps, as well as magically constructed dungeons inhabited by monsters created by magic, cursed by magic, or endowed with magical <span class=\"No-Break\">abilities.</span></p><h3>It’s Your World</h3><p>In creating your campaign world, it helps to start with the core assumptions and consider how your setting might change them. The subsequent sections of this chapter address each element and give details on how to flesh out your world with gods, factions, and<span class=\"No-Break\"> so forth.</span></p><p>The assumptions sketched out above aren’t carved in stone. They inspire exciting D&amp;D worlds full of adventure, but they’re not the only set of assumptions that can do so. You can build an interesting campaign concept by altering one or more of those core assumptions, just as well-established D&amp;D worlds have done. Ask yourself, “What if the standard assumptions weren’t true in <span class=\"No-Break\">my world?”</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The World Is a Mundane Place.</span></strong> What if magic is rare and dangerous, and even adventurers have limited or no access to it? What if your campaign is set in a version of our own world’<span class=\"No-Break\">s history?</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The World Is New.</span></strong> What if your world is new, and the characters are the first of a long line of heroes? The adventurers might be champions of the first great empires, such as the empires of Netheril and Cormanthor in the Forgotten Realm<span class=\"No-Break\">s setting.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The World Is Known.</span></strong> What if the world is completely charted and mapped, right down to the “Here there be dragons” notations? What if great empires cover huge stretches of countryside, with clearly defined borders between them? The Five Nations of the Eberron setting were once part of a great empire, and magically aided travel between its cities is co<span class=\"No-Break\">mmonplace.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Monsters Are Uncommon.</span></strong> What if monsters are rare and terrifying? In the Ravenloft setting, horrific domains are governed by monstrous rulers. The populace lives in perpetual terror of these darklords and their evil minions, but other monsters rarely trouble people’s da<span class=\"No-Break\">ily lives.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Magic Is Everywhere.</span></strong> What if every town is ruled by a powerful wizard? What if magic item shops are common? The Eberron setting makes the use of magic an everyday occurrence, as magical flying ships and trains carry travelers from one great city t<span class=\"No-Break\">o another.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Gods Inhabit the Land, or Are Entirely Absent.</span></strong> What if the gods regularly walk the earth? What if the characters can challenge them and seize their power? Or what if the gods are remote, and even angels never make contact with mortals? In the Dark Sun setting, the gods are extremely distant — perhaps nonexistent — and clerics rely instead on elemental power for th<span class=\"No-Break\">eir magic.</span></p><h2>Gods of Your World</h2><p>The <a title=\"Gods of the Multiverse\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/appendix-b-gods-of-the-multiverse\">Gods of the Multiverse</a>&nbsp;appendix in the <em>Player’s Handbook</em>&nbsp;presents a number of pantheons (loose groupings of deities not united by a single doctrine or philosophy) for use in your game, including the gods of established D&amp;D worlds and fantasy-historical pantheons. You can adopt one of these pantheons for your campaign, or pick and choose deities and ideas from them as you please. See “<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/a-world-of-your-own#ASamplePantheon\">A Sample Pantheon</a>” in this section for a<span class=\"No-Break\">n example.</span></p><p>As far as the game’s rules are concerned, it doesn’t matter if your world has hundreds of deities or a church devoted to a single god. In rules terms, clerics choose domains, not deities, so your world can associate domains with deities in any way y<span class=\"No-Break\">ou choose.</span></p><h3>Loose Pantheons</h3><p>Most D&amp;D worlds have a loose pantheon of gods. A multitude of deities rule the various aspects of existence, variously cooperating with and competing against one another to administer the affairs of the universe. People gather in public shrines to worship gods of life and wisdom, or meet in hidden places to venerate gods of deception or de<span class=\"No-Break\">struction.</span></p><p>Each deity in a pantheon has a portfolio and is responsible for advancing that portfolio. In the Greyhawk setting, Heironeous is a god of valor who calls clerics and paladins to his service and encourages them to spread the ideals of honorable warfare, chivalry, and justice in society. Even in the midst of his everlasting war with his brother Hextor, god of war and tyranny, Heironeous promotes his own portfolio: war fought nobly and in the cause o<span class=\"No-Break\">f justice.</span></p><p>People in most D&amp;D worlds are polytheistic, honoring deities of their own and acknowledging pantheons of other cultures. Individuals pay homage to various gods, regardless of alignment. In the Forgotten Realms, a person might propitiate Umberlee before setting out to sea, join a communal feast to celebrate Chauntea at harvest time, and pray to Malar before goin<span class=\"No-Break\">g hunting.</span></p><p>Some individuals feel a calling to a particular deity’s service and claim that god as a patron. Particularly devoted individuals become priests by setting up a shrine or helping to staff a holy site. Much more rarely, those who feel such a calling become clerics or paladins invested with the responsibility of true div<span class=\"No-Break\">ine power.</span></p><p>Shrines and temples serve as community gathering points for religious rites and festivals. Priests at such sites relate stories of the gods, teach the ethics of their patron deities, offer advice and blessings, perform religious rites, and provide training in activities their deities favor. Cities and large towns can host several temples dedicated to individual gods important to the community, while smaller settlements might have a single shrine devoted to any gods the loca<span class=\"No-Break\">ls revere.</span></p><p>To quickly build a pantheon for your world, create a single god for each of the eight domains available to clerics: Death, Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, and War. You can invent names and personalities for these deities, or borrow deities from other pantheons. This approach gives you a small pantheon that covers the most significant aspects of existence, and it’s easy enough to extrapolate other areas of life each deity controls. The god of Knowledge, for example, might also be patron of magic and prophecy, while the god of Light could be the sun god and the go<span class=\"No-Break\">d of time.</span></p><h4>A Sample Pantheon</h4><p>The pantheon of the Dawn War is an example of a pantheon assembled from mostly preexisting elements to suit the needs of a particular campaign. This is the default pantheon in the fourth edition <span class=\"italic\"><em>Player’s Handbook</em></span> (2008). The pantheon is summarized in the Dawn War Deit<span class=\"No-Break\">ies table.</span></p><p>This pantheon draws in several nonhuman deities and establishes them as universal gods. These gods include Bahamut, Corellon, Gruumsh, Lolth, Moradin, Sehanine, and Tiamat. Humans worship Moradin and Corellon as gods of their respective portfolios, rather than as racial deities. The pantheon also includes the archdevil Asmodeus as god of domination an<span class=\"No-Break\">d tyranny.</span></p><p>Several of the gods are drawn from other pantheons, sometimes with new names for the gods. Bane comes from the Forgotten Realms. From Greyhawk come Kord, Pelor, Tharizdun, and Vecna. From the Greek pantheon come Athena (renamed Erathis) and Tyche (renamed Avandra), though both are altered. Set (renamed Zehir) comes from the Egyptian pantheon. The Raven Queen is akin to the Norse pantheon’s Hel and Greyhawk’s Wee Jas. That leaves three gods created from scratch: Ioun, Melora, <span class=\"No-Break\">and Torog.</span></p><h4>Dawn War Deities</h4><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"Table--no-space-after-

Systems</h3><p>In your campaign, you can create pantheons of gods who are closely linked in a single religion, monotheistic religions (worship of a single deity), dualistic systems (centered on two opposing deities or forces), mystery cults (involving personal devotion to a single deity, usually as part of a pantheon system), animistic religions (revering the spirits inherent in nature), or even forces and philosophies that don’t center o<span class=\"No-Break\">n deities.</span></p><h4>Tight Pantheons</h4><p>In contrast to a loose pantheon, a tight pantheon focuses on a single religion whose teachings and edicts embrace a small group of deities. Followers of a tight pantheon might favor one of its member deities over another, but they respect all the deities and honor them with sacrifices and prayer as ap<span class=\"No-Break\">propriate.</span></p><p>The key trait to a tight pantheon is that its worshipers embrace a single ethos or dogma that includes all the deities. The gods of the tight pantheon work as one to protect and guide their followers. You can think of a tight pantheon as similar to a family. One or two deities who lead the pantheon serve as parent figures, with the rest serving as patrons of important aspects of the culture that worships the pantheon. A single temple honors all members of the<span class=\"No-Break\"> pantheon.</span></p><p>Most tight pantheons have one or more aberrant gods — deities whose worship isn’t sanctioned by the priests of the pantheon as a whole. These are usually evil deities and enemies of the pantheon, such as the Greek Titans. These deities have cults of their own, attracting social outcasts and villains to their worship. These cults resemble mystery cults, their members strictly devoted to their single god, though even members of aberrant cults pay lip service in the temples of the tight<span class=\"No-Break\"> pantheon.</span></p><p>The Norse deities serve as an example of a tight pantheon. Odin is the pantheon’s leader and father figure. Deities such as Thor, Tyr, and Freya embody important aspects of Norse culture. Meanwhile, Loki and his devotees lurk in the shadows, sometimes aiding the other deities, and sometimes working against them with the pantheon’<span class=\"No-Break\">s enemies.</span></p><h4>Mystery Cults</h4><p>A mystery cult is a secretive religious organization based on a ritual of initiation, in which the initiate is mystically identified with a god, or a handful of related gods. Mystery cults are intensely personal, concerned with the initiate’s relationship with t<span class=\"No-Break\">he divine.</span></p><p>Sometimes a mystery cult is a type of worship within a pantheon. It acknowledges the myths and rituals of the pantheon, but presents its own myths and rites as primary. For instance, a secretive order of monks might immerse themselves in a mystical relationship to a god who is part of a broadly worshiped<span class=\"No-Break\"> pantheon.</span></p><p>A mystery cult emphasizes the history of its god, which is symbolically reenacted in its initiation ritual. The foundation myth of a mystery cult is usually simple and often involves a god’s death and rising, or a journey to the underworld and a return. Mystery cults often revere sun and moon deities and agricultural deities — gods whose portfolios reflect the cycles <span class=\"No-Break\">of nature.</span></p><p>The cult’s ritual of initiation follows the pattern of its foundation myth. Neophytes retrace the god’s footsteps in order to share the god’s ultimate fate. In the case of dying and rising gods, the symbolic death of the initiate represents the idea of death to the old life and rebirth into a transformed existence. Initiates are born into a new life, remaining in the world of mortal affairs but feeling elevated to a higher sphere. The initiate is promised a place in the god’s realm after death, but also experiences new meanin<span class=\"No-Break\">g in life.</span></p><h4>Monotheism</h4><p>Monotheistic religions revere only one deity, and in some cases, deny the existence of any other deity. If you introduce a monotheistic religion into your campaign, you need to decide whether other gods exist. Even if they don’t, other religions can exist side by side with the monotheistic religion. If these religions have clerics with spellcasting ability, their spells might be powered by the one true deity, by lesser spirits who aren’t deities (possibly including powerful aberrations, celestials, fey, fiends, or elementals), or simply by th<span class=\"No-Break\">eir faith.</span></p><p>The deity of a monotheistic religion has an extensive portfolio and is portrayed as the creator of everything, in control of everything, and concerned with every aspect of existence. Thus, a worshiper of this god offers prayers and sacrifices to the same god regardless of what aspect of life is in need of divine assistance. Whether marching into war, setting off on a journey, or hoping to win someone’s affections, the worshiper prays to the<span class=\"No-Break\"> same god.</span></p><p>Some monotheistic religions describe different aspects of their deity. A single god appears in different aspects as the Creator and the Destroyer, and the clerics of that god focus on one aspect or the other, determining their domain access and possibly even their alignment on that basis. A cleric who venerates the Destroyer aspect chooses the Tempest or War domain, while one who worships a Creator aspect chooses the Life or Nature domains. In some monotheistic religions, clerics group themselves into distinct religious orders to differentiate clerics who choose differen<span class=\"No-Break\">t domains.</span></p><h4>Dualism</h4><p>A dualistic religion views the world as the stage for a conflict between two diametrically opposed deities or divine forces. Most often, the opposed forces are good and evil, or opposed deities representing those forces. In some pantheons, the forces or deities of law and chaos are the fundamental opposites in a dualistic system. Life and death, light and darkness, matter and spirit, body and mind, health and illness, purity and defilement, positive energy and negative energy — the D&amp;D universe is full of polar opposites that could serve as the foundation for a dualistic religion. Whatever the terms in which the dualism is expressed, half of the pair is usually believed to be good — beneficial, desirable, or holy — while the other half is considered bad, if not explicitly evil. If the fundamental conflict in a religion is expressed as the opposition between matter and spirit, the followers of that religion believe that one of the two (usually matter) is evil and the other (spirit) is good, and so seek to liberate their spirits from this material world and its evils through asceticism and cont<span class=\"No-Break\">emplation.</span></p><p>Rare dualistic systems believe that the two opposing forces must remain in balance, always pulling away from each other but remaining bound together in creativ<span class=\"No-Break\">e tension.</span></p><p>In a cosmology defined by an eternal conflict between good and evil, mortals are expected to take sides. The majority of those who follow a dualistic religion worship the deity or force identified as good. Worshipers of the good deity trust themselves to that god’s power to protect them from the evil deity’s minions. Because the evil deity in such a religion is usually the source of everything that is detrimental to existence, only the perverse and depraved worship this god. Monsters and fiends serve it, as do certain secretive cults. The myths of a dualistic religion usually predict that the good deity will triumph in an apocalyptic battle, but the forces of evil believe that the outcome of that battle isn’t predetermined and work to promote their deity’<span class=\"No-Break\">s victory.</span></p><p>Deities in a dualistic system maintain large portfolios. All aspects of existence reflect the dualistic struggle, and therefore all things can fall on one side or the other of the conflict. Agriculture, mercy, the sky, medicine, and poetry reside in the portfolio of the good deity, and famine, hatred, disease, and war belong to the e<span class=\"No-Break\">vil deity.</span></p><h4>Animism</h4><p>Animism is the belief that spirits inhabit every part of the natural world. In an animistic worldview, everything has a spirit, from the grandest mountain to the lowliest rock, from the great ocean to a babbling brook, from the sun and moon to a fighter’s ancestral sword. All these objects, and the spirits that inhabit them, are sentient, though some are more aware, alert, and intelligent than others. The most powerful spirits might even be considered deities. All are worthy of respect if not v<span class=\"No-Break\">eneration.</span></p><p>Animists don’t typically pay allegiance to one spirit over the others. Instead, they offer prayers and sacrifices to different spirits at different times, as appropriate to the situation. A pious character might make daily prayers and offerings to ancestor spirits and the spirits of the house, regular petitions to important spirits such as the Seven Fortunes of Good Luck, occasional sacrifices of incense to location spirits such as the spirit of a forest, and sporadic prayers to a host of other spirit<span class=\"No-Break\">s as well.</span></p><p>An animistic religion very tolerant. Most spirits don’t care to whom a character also offers sacrifices, as long as they receive the sacrifices and respect they are due. As new religions spread through animist lands, those religions typically win adherents but not converts. People incorporate new spirits and deities into their prayers without displacing the old ones. Contemplatives and scholars adopt complex philosophical systems and practices without changing their belief in and respect for the spirits they already<span class=\"No-Break\"> venerate.</span></p><p>Animism functions as a large tight pantheon. Animist clerics serve the pantheon as a whole, and so can choose any domain, representing a favorite spirit for th<span class=\"No-Break\">at cleric.</span></p><h4>Forces and Philosophies</h4><p>Not all divine powers need to be derived from deities. In some campaigns, believers hold enough conviction in their ideas about the universe that they gain magical power from that conviction. In other campaigns, impersonal forces of nature or magic replace the gods by granting power to mortals attuned to them. Just as druids and rangers can gain their spell ability from the force of nature rather than from a specific nature deity, some clerics devote themselves to ideals rather than to a god. Paladins might serve a philosophy of justice and chivalry rather than a speci<span class=\"No-Break\">fic deity.</span></p><p>Forces and philosophies aren’t worshiped; they aren’t beings that can hear and respond to prayers or accept sacrifices. Devotion to a philosophy or a force isn’t necessarily exclusive of service to a deity. A person can be devoted to the philosophy of good and offer worship to various good deities, or revere the force of nature and also pay homage to the gods of nature, who might be seen as personal manifestations of an impersonal force. In a world that includes deities with demonstrable power (through their clerics), it’s unusual for a philosophy to deny the existence of deities, although a common philosophical belief states that the deities are more like mortals than they would have mortals believe. According to such philosophies, the gods aren’t truly immortal (just very long-lived), and mortals can attain divinity. In fact, ascending to godhood is the ultimate goal of some phi<span class=\"No-Break\">losophies.</span></p><p>The power of a philosophy stems from the belief that mortals invest in it. A philosophy that only one person believes in isn’t strong enough to bestow magical power on th<span class=\"No-Break\">at person.</span></p><h3>Humanoids and the Gods</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/802/c1-01.png\"></p><p>When it comes to the gods, humans exhibit a far wider range of beliefs and institutions than other races do. In many D&amp;D settings, orcs, elves, dwarves, goblins, and other humanoids have tight pantheons. It is expected that an orc will worship Gruumsh or one of a handful of subordinate deities. In comparison, humanity embraces a staggering variety of deities. Each human culture might have its own arra<span class=\"No-Break\">y of gods.</span></p><p>In most D&amp;D settings, there is no single god that can claim to have created humanity. Thus, the human proclivity for building institutions extends to religion. A single charismatic prophet can convert an entire kingdom to the worship of a new god. With that prophet’s death, the religion might wax or wane, or the prophet’s followers might turn against one another and found several competing <span class=\"No-Break\">religions.</span></p><p>In comparison, religion in dwarven society is set in stone. The dwarves of the Forgotten Realms identify Moradin as their creator. While individual dwarves might follow other gods, as a culture the dwarves are pledged to Moradin and the pantheon he leads. His teachings and magic are so thoroughly ingrained in dwarven culture that it would take a cataclysmic shift to re<span class=\"No-Break\">place him.</span></p><p>With that in mind, consider the role of the gods in your world and their ties to different humanoid races. Does each race have a creator god? How does that god shape that race’s culture? Are other folk free of such divine ties and free to worship as they wish? Has a race turned against the god that created it? Has a new race appeared, created by a god within the past <span class=\"No-Break\">few years?</span></p><p>A deity might also have ties to a kingdom, noble line, or other cultural institution. With the death of the emperor, a new ruler might be selected by divine portents sent by the deity who protected the empire in its earliest days. In such a land, the worship of other gods might be outlawed or tightly c<span class=\"No-Break\">ontrolled.</span></p><p>Finally, consider the difference between gods who are tied to specific humanoid races and gods with more diverse followers. Do the races with their own pantheons enjoy a place of privilege in your world, with their gods taking an active role in their affairs? Are the other races ignored by the gods, or are those races the deciding factor that can tilt the balance of power in favor of one god o<span class=\"No-Break\">r another?<br></span></p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>DIVINE RANK</strong></p>\n<p>The divine beings of the multiverse are often categorized according to their cosmic power. Some gods are worshiped on multiple worlds and have a different rank on each world, depending on their influe<span class=\"No-Break\">nce there.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Greater deities</strong> are beyond mortal understanding. They can’t be summoned, and they are almost always removed from direct involvement in mortal affairs. On very rare occasions they manifest avatars similar to lesser deities, but slaying a greater god’s avatar has no effect on the g<span class=\"No-Break\">od itself.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Lesser deities</strong> are embodied somewhere in the planes. Some lesser deities live in the Material Plane, as does the unicorn-goddess Lurue of the Forgotten Realms and the titanic shark-god Sekolah revered by the sahuagin. Others live on the Outer Planes, as Lolth does in the Abyss. Such deities can be encountered b<span class=\"No-Break\">y mortals.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Quasi-deities</strong> have a divine origin, but they don’t hear or answer prayers, grant spells to clerics, or control aspects of mortal life. They are still immensely powerful beings, and in theory they could ascend to godhood if they amassed enough worshipers. Quasi-deities fall into three subcategories: demigods, titans, and<span class=\"No-Break\"> vestiges.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"italic\">Demigods</span> are born from the union of a deity and a mortal being. They have some divine attributes, but their mortal parentage makes them the weakest quas<span class=\"No-Break\">i-deities.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"italic\">Titans</span> are the divine creations of deities. They might be birthed from the union of two deities, manufactured on a divine forge, born from the blood spilled by a god, or otherwise brought about through divine will or <span class=\"No-Break\">substance.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"italic\">Vestiges</span> are deities who have lost nearly all their worshipers and are considered dead, from a mortal perspective. Esoteric rituals can sometimes contact these beings and draw on their lat<span class=\"No-Break\">ent power.</span></p>\n</blockquote><h2>Mapping Your Campaign</h2><p>When creating the world where your campaign takes place, you’ll want a map. You can take one of two approaches with it: top-down or bottom-up. Some DMs like to start at the top, creating the big picture of the world at the start of the campaign by having a map that shows whole continents, and then zooming in on smaller areas. Other DMs prefer to go the opposite direction, starting with a small campaign area that is mapped at a province or kingdom scale, then zooming out as adventures take the characters into new <span class=\"No-Break\">territory.</span></p><p>Whichever approach you take, hexes work well for mapping outdoor environments where travel can go in any direction and calculating distance might be important. A single sheet of hex paper with 5 hexes to the inch is ideal for most maps. Use a scale for your map that’s best suited to the level of detail you want. <a title=\"Adventure Environments\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/adventure-environments\">Chapter 5</a>&nbsp;offers more information about creating and mapping wildern<span class=\"No-Break\">ess areas.</span></p><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/803/c1-02.png\"></span></p><h3>Province Scale</h3><p>For the most detailed areas of your world, use a province scale where each hex represents 1 mile. A full-page map at this scale represents an area that can be covered in one day’s travel in any direction from the center of the map, assuming clear terrain. As such, province scale is a useful scale for mapping a campaign’s starting area (see “<a title=\"Creating a Campaign\" href=\"#CreatingaCampaign\">Creating a Campaign</a>,” later in this chapter) or any location where you expect to track the adventurers’ movement in hours rather <span class=\"No-Break\">than days.</span></p><p>The ground cover of an area this size will include broad stretches of one predominant terrain type, broken up by other isolated terr<span class=\"No-Break\">ain types.</span></p><p>A settled region mapped at this scale might have one town and eight to twelve villages or farming hamlets. A wilder region might have only a single keep, or no settlements at all. You can also indicate the extent of the cleared farmland that surrounds each city or town. On a province-scale map, this will show as a belt a few hexes wide surrounding each town or village. Even small villages farm most of the arable land within a mi<span class=\"No-Break\">le or two.</span></p><h3>Kingdom Scale</h3><p>On a kingdom-scale map, each hex represents 6 miles. A map at this scale covers a large region, about the size of Great Britain or half the size of the state of California. That’s plenty of room for ad<span class=\"No-Break\">venturing.</span></p><p>The first step of mapping a region at this scale is to sketch out the coastlines and any major bodies of water in the area. Is the region landlocked or on a coast? A coastal region might include islands offshore, and a landlocked area might include an inland sea or major lakes. Alternatively, the region could consist of a single large island, or an isthmus or peninsula with multiple c<span class=\"No-Break\">oastlines.</span></p><p>Next, sketch in any major mountain ranges. Foothills form a transition between the mountains and lowlands, and broad patches of gentle hills might dot t<span class=\"No-Break\">he region.</span></p><p>That leaves the rest of your map for relatively flat terrain: grasslands, forests, swamps, and the like. Place these elements as yo<span class=\"No-Break\">u see fit.</span></p><p>Map out the courses of any rivers that flow through the area. Rivers are born in mountains or inland areas that see a lot of rainfall, winding down to the nearest major body of water that doesn’t require the river to cross over higher elevation. Tributaries join rivers as they grow larger and move toward a lake o<span class=\"No-Break\">r the sea.</span></p><p>Finally, place the major towns and cities of the region. At this scale, you don’t need to worry about small towns and villages, or about mapping every belt of farmland. Even so, a settled region this size might easily have eight to twelve cities or towns to put o<span class=\"No-Break\">n the map.</span></p><h3>Continent Scale</h3><p>For mapping a whole continent, use a scale where 1 hex represents 60 miles. At this scale, you can’t see more than the shape of coastlines, the biggest mountain ranges, major rivers, huge lakes, and political boundaries. A map at this scale is best for showing how multiple kingdom-scale maps fit together, rather than tracking the movement of adventurers d<span class=\"No-Break\">ay by day.</span></p><p>The same process you use for mapping a region at kingdom scale works for mapping a whole continent. A continent might have eight to twelve large cities that deserve a place on the map, most likely major trade centers and the capitals of<span class=\"No-Break\"> kingdoms.</span></p><h3>Combining Scales</h3><p>Whichever scale you start with, it’s easy to zoom in or out on your maps. At continent scale, 1 hex represents the same area as 10 kingdom-scale hexes. Two cities that are 3 hexes (180 miles) apart on your continent map would be 30 hexes apart on your kingdom map, and might define the opposite ends of the region you’re detailing. At kingdom scale, 1 hex equals 6 province-scale hexes, so it’s easy to put the region covered by your province-scale map into the center of a kingdom-scale map and create interesting areas <span class=\"No-Break\">around it.</span></p><h2>Settlements</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/804/c1-03.png\"></p><p>The places where people live — bustling cities, prosperous towns, and tiny villages nestled among miles of farmland — help define the nature of civilization in your world. A single settlement — a home base for your adventurers — is a great place to start a campaign and begin your world building. Consider the following questions as you create any settlement in y<span class=\"No-Break\">our world:</span></p><ul>\n<li>What purpose does it serve in <span class=\"No-Break\">your game?</span></li>\n<li>How big is it? Who li<span class=\"No-Break\">ves there?</span></li>\n<li>What does it look, smell, and s<span class=\"No-Break\">ound like?</span></li>\n<li>Who governs it? Who else holds power? Is it part of a lar<span class=\"No-Break\">ger state?</span></li>\n<li>What are its<span class=\"No-Break\"> defenses?</span></li>\n<li>Where do characters go to find the goods and services <span class=\"No-Break\">they need?</span></li>\n<li>What temples and other organizations feature pr<span class=\"No-Break\">ominently?</span></li>\n<li>What fantastic elements distinguish it from an ordi<span class=\"No-Break\">nary town?</span></li>\n<li>Why should the characters care about the s<span class=\"No-Break\">ettlement?</span></li>\n</ul><p>The guidelines in this section are here to help you build the settlement you want for whatever purpose you have in mind. Disregard any advice here that runs counter to your vision for a s<span class=\"No-Break\">ettlement.</span></p><h3>Purpose</h3><p>A settlement exists primarily to facilitate the story and fun of your campaign. Other than that point, the settlement’s purpose determines the amount of detail you put into it. Create only the features of a settlement that you know you’ll need, along with notes on general features. Then allow the place to grow organically as the adventurers interact with more and more of it, keeping notes on new places y<span class=\"No-Break\">ou invent.</span></p><h4>Local Color</h4><p>A settlement might serve as a place where the characters stop to rest and to buy supplies. A settlement of this sort needs no more than a brief description. Include the settlement’s name, decide how big it is, add a dash of flavor (“The smell of the local tanneries never lifts from this town”), and let the adventurers get on with their business. The history of the inn where the characters spend the night, the mannerisms of the shopkeeper they buy supplies from — you can add this level of detail, but you don’t have to. If the characters return to the same settlement, start adding these local features so that it begins to feel a little more like a home base, albeit a temporary one. Let the settlement develop as the ne<span class=\"No-Break\">ed arises.</span></p><h4>Home Base</h4><p>A settlement gives the adventurers a place to live, train, and recuperate between adventures. An entire campaign can center on a particular town or city. Such a settlement is the launching pad from which the characters go out into the wi<span class=\"No-Break\">der world.</span></p><p>Designed well, a home base can hold a special place in the adventurers’ hearts, particularly if they care about one or more NPCs who l<span class=\"No-Break\">ive there.</span></p><p>To make a home base come alive, you’ll need to invest some time fleshing out details, but the players can help you with that work. Ask them to tell you a bit about mentors, family members, and other important people in their characters’ lives. Feel free to add to and modify what they give you, but you’ll start with a solid foundation of the nonplayer characters (NPCs) who are important to the characters. Let the players describe where and how their characters spend their time — a favorite tavern, library, or temple<span class=\"No-Break\">, perhaps.</span></p><p>Using these NPCs and locations as a starting point, flesh out the settlement’s cast of characters. Detail its leadership, including law enforcement (discussed later in the chapter). Include characters who can provide information, such as sages, soothsayers, librarians, and observant vagabonds. Priests can provide spellcasting as well as information. Make note of merchants who might regularly interact with the adventurers and perhaps compete with one another for the party’s business. Think about the people who run the adventurers’ favorite tavern. And then add a handful of wild cards: a shady dealer, a mad prophet, a retired mercenary, a drunken rake, or anyone else who adds a dash of adventure and intrigue to your<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><h4>Adventure Site</h4><p>A village harboring a secret cult of devil worshipers. A town controlled by a guild of wererats. A city conquered by a hobgoblin army. These settlements aren’t merely rest stops but locations where adventures unfold. In a settlement that doubles as an adventure location, detail the intended adventure areas, such as towers and warehouses. For an event-based adventure, note the NPCs who play a part in the adventure. This work is adventure preparation as much as it is world building, and the cast of characters you develop for your adventure — including allies, patrons, enemies, and extras — can become recurring figures in your<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><h3>Size</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/805/c1-04.png\"></p><p>Most settlements in a D&amp;D world are villages clustered around a larger town or city. Farming villages supply the town or city population with food in exchange for goods the farmers can’t produce themselves. Towns and cities are the seats of the nobles who govern the surrounding area, and who carry the responsibility for defending the villages from attack. Occasionally, a local lord or lady lives in a keep or fortress with no nearby tow<span class=\"No-Break\">n or city.</span></p><h4>Village</h4><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Population:</span></strong> Up to a<span class=\"No-Break\">bout 1,000</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Government:</span></strong> A noble (usually not a resident) rules the village, with an appointed agent (a reeve) in residence to adjudicate disputes and coll<span class=\"No-Break\">ect taxes.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Defense:</span></strong> The reeve might have a small force of soldiers. Otherwise, the village relies on a citize<span class=\"No-Break\">n militia.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Commerce:</span></strong> Basic supplies are readily available, possibly from an inn or a trading post. Other goods are available from traveling <span class=\"No-Break\">merchants.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Organizations:</span></strong> A village might contain one or two temples or shrines, but few or no other orga<span class=\"No-Break\">nizations.</span></p><p>Most settlements are agricultural villages, supporting themselves and nearby towns or cities with crops and meat. Villagers produce food in one way or another — if not by tending the crops, then supporting those who do by shoeing horses, weaving clothes, milling grain, and the like. The goods they produce feed their families and supply trade with nearby se<span class=\"No-Break\">ttlements.</span></p><p>A village’s population is dispersed around a large area of land. Farmers live on their land, which spreads them widely around the village center. At the heart of the village, a handful of structures cluster together: a well, a marketplace, a small temple or two, a gathering place, and perhaps an inn for <span class=\"No-Break\">travelers.</span></p><h4>Town</h4><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Population:</span></strong> Up to a<span class=\"No-Break\">bout 6,000</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Government:</span></strong> A resident noble rules and appoints a lord mayor to oversee administration. An elected town council represents the interests of the mid<span class=\"No-Break\">dle class.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Defense:</span></strong> The noble commands a sizable army of professional soldiers, as well as personal b<span class=\"No-Break\">odyguards.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Commerce:</span></strong> Basic supplies are readily available, though exotic goods and services are harder to find. Inns and taverns support <span class=\"No-Break\">travelers.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Organizations:</span></strong> The town contains several temples, as well as various merchant guilds and other orga<span class=\"No-Break\">nizations.</span></p><p>Towns are major trade centers, situated where important industries and reliable trade routes enabled the population to grow. These settlements rely on commerce: the import of raw materials and food from surrounding villages, and the export of crafted items to those villages, as well as to other towns and cities. A town’s population is more diverse than that of most<span class=\"No-Break\"> villages.</span></p><p>Towns arise where roads intersect waterways, at the meeting of major land trade routes, around strategic defensive locations, or near significant mines or similar natural <span class=\"No-Break\">resources.</span></p><h4>City</h4><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Population: </span></strong>Up to ab<span class=\"No-Break\">out 25,000</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Government: </span></strong>A resident noble presides, with several other nobles sharing responsibility for surrounding areas and government functions. One such noble is the lord mayor, who oversees the city administration. An elected city council represents the middle class and might hold more actual power than the lord mayor. Other groups serve as important power center<span class=\"No-Break\">s as well.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Defense:</span></strong> The city supports an army of professional soldiers, guards, and town watch. Each noble in residence maintains a small force of personal b<span class=\"No-Break\">odyguards.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Commerce:</span></strong> Almost any goods or services are readily available. Many inns and taverns support <span class=\"No-Break\">travelers.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Organizations:</span></strong> A multitude of temples, guilds, and other organizations, some of which hold significant power in city affairs, can be found within the cit<span class=\"No-Break\">y’s walls.</span></p><p>Cities are cradles of civilization. Their larger populations require considerable support from both surrounding villages and trade routes, so they’re rare. Cities typically thrive in areas where large expanses of fertile, arable land surround a location accessible to trade, almost always on a navigable<span class=\"No-Break\"> waterway.</span></p><p>Cities almost always have walls, and the stages of a city’s growth are easily identified by the expansion of the walls beyond the central core. These internal walls naturally divide the city into wards (neighborhoods defined by specific features), which have their own representatives on the city council and their own noble admin<span class=\"No-Break\">istrators.</span></p><p>Cities that hold more than twenty-five thousand people are extremely rare. Metropolises such as Waterdeep in the Forgotten Realms, Sharn in Eberron, and the Free City of Greyhawk stand as vital beacons of civilization in the D<span class=\"No-Break\">&amp;D worlds.</span></p><h3>Atmosphere</h3><p>What do the adventurers first notice as they approach or enter a settlement? The towering wall bristling with soldiers? The beggars with hands outstretched, pleading for aid outside the gate? The noisy hubbub of merchants and buyers thronging the market square? The overpowering stench <span class=\"No-Break\">of manure?</span></p><p>Sensory details help bring a settlement to life and vividly communicate its personality to your players. Settle on a single defining factor that sums up a settlement’s personality and extrapolate from there. Maybe a city is built around canals, like real-world Venice. That key element suggests a wealth of sensory details: the sight of colorful boats floating on muddy waters, the sound of lapping waves and perhaps singing gondoliers, the smells of fish and waste polluting the water, the feel of humidity. Or perhaps the city is shrouded in fog much of the time, and you describe the tendrils of cold mist reaching through every crack and cranny, the muffled sounds of hooves on cobblestones, the cold air with the smell of rain, and a sense of mystery and lurki<span class=\"No-Break\">ng danger.</span></p><p>The climate and terrain of a settlement’s environment, its origin and inhabitants, its government and political position, and its commercial importance all have a bearing on its overall atmosphere. A city nestled against the edge of a jungle has a very different feel than one on the edge of a desert. Elf and dwarf cities present a distinct aesthetic, clearly identifiable in contrast to human-built ones. Soldiers patrol the streets to quell any hint of dissent in a city ruled by a tyrant, while a city fostering an early system of democracy might boast an open-air market where philosophical ideas are traded as freely as produce. All the possible combinations of these factors can inspire endless variety in the settlements of your campa<span class=\"No-Break\">ign world.</span></p><h3>Government</h3><p>In the feudal society common in most D&amp;D worlds, power and authority are concentrated in towns and cities. Nobles hold authority over the settlements where they live and the surrounding lands. They collect taxes from the populace, which they use for public building projects, to pay the soldiery, and to support a comfortable lifestyle for themselves (although nobles often have considerable hereditary wealth). In exchange, they promise to protect their citizens from threats such as orc marauders, hobgoblin armies, and roving huma<span class=\"No-Break\">n bandits.</span></p><p>Nobles appoint officers as their agents in villages, to supervise the collection of taxes and serve as judges in disputes and criminal trials. These reeves, sheriffs, or bailiffs are commoners native to the villages they govern, chosen for their positions because they already hold the respect of their fellow<span class=\"No-Break\"> citizens.</span></p><p>Within towns and cities, lords share authority and administrative responsibility with lesser nobles (usually their own relatives), and also with representatives of the middle class, such as traders and artisans. A lord mayor of noble birth is appointed to head the town or city council and to perform the same administrative functions that reeves carry out in villages. The council consists of representatives elected by the middle class. Only foolish nobles ignore the wishes of their councils, since the economic power of the middle class is often more important to the prosperity of a town or city than the hereditary authority of the<span class=\"No-Break\"> nobility.</span></p><p>The larger a settlement, the more likely that other individuals or organizations hold significant power there as well. Even in a village, a popular individual — a wise elder or a well-liked farmer — can wield more influence than the appointed reeve, and a wise reeve avoids making an enemy of such a person. In towns and cities, the same power might lie in the hands of a prominent temple, a guild independent of the council, or an individual with magi<span class=\"No-Break\">cal power.</span></p><h4>Forms of Government</h4><p>A settlement rarely stands alone. A given town or city might be a theocratic city-state or a prosperous free city governed by a merchant council. More likely, it’s part of a feudal kingdom, a bureaucratic empire, or a remote realm ruled by an iron-fisted tyrant. Consider how your settlement fits into the bigger picture of your world or region — who rules its ruler, and what other settlements might also lie under it<span class=\"No-Break\">s control.</span></p><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1975830939\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[vwRAVWIPdmrWohYc]{Government}</span></div></div></div><p>Typical and fantastical forms of government are described below. Choose one or randomly determine a form of government for a nation or city from the Forms of Governm<span class=\"No-Break\">ent table.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Autocracy.</span></strong> One hereditary ruler wields absolute power. The autocrat either is supported by a well-developed bureaucracy or military or stands as the only authority in an otherwise anarchic society. The dynastic ruler could be immortal or undead. Aundair and Karrnath, two kingdoms in the Eberron campaign setting, have autocrats with royal blood in their veins. Whereas Queen Aurala of Aundair relies on wizards and spies to enforce her will, Kaius, the vampire king of Karrnath, has a formidable army of living and undead soldiers under hi<span class=\"No-Break\">s command.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Bureaucracy.</span></strong> Various departments compose the government, each responsible for an aspect of rule. The department heads, ministers, or secretaries answer to a figurehead autocrat o<span class=\"No-Break\">r council.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Confederacy.</span></strong> Each individual city or town within the confederacy governs itself, but all contribute to a league or federation that promotes (at least in theory) the common good of all member states. Conditions and attitudes toward the central government vary from place to place within the confederacy. The Lords’ Alliance in the Forgotten Realms setting is a loose confederacy of cities, while the Mror Holds in the Eberron campaign setting is a confederacy of allied dw<span class=\"No-Break\">arf clans.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Democracy.</span></strong> Citizens or their elected representatives determine the laws in a democracy. A bureaucracy or military carries out the day-to-day work of government, with positions filled through open <span class=\"No-Break\">elections.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Dictatorship. </span></strong>One supreme ruler holds absolute authority, but his or her rule isn’t necessarily dynastic. In other respects this resembles an autocracy. In the Greyhawk campaign setting, a half-demon named Iuz is the dictator of a conquered land that bears<span class=\"No-Break\"> his name.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Feudalism.</span></strong> The typical government of Europe in the Middle Ages, a feudalistic society consists of layers of lords and vassals. The vassals provide soldiers or scutage (payment in lieu of military service) to the lords, who in turn promise protection to thei<span class=\"No-Break\">r vassals.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Gerontocracy.</span></strong> Elders preside over this society. In some cases, long-lived races such as elves or dragons are entrusted with the leadership of<span class=\"No-Break\"> the land.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Hierarchy.</span></strong> A feudal or bureaucratic government where every member, except one, is subordinate to another member. In the Dragonlance campaign setting, the dragonarmies of Krynn form a military hierarchy, with the Dragon Highlords as leaders under the dragon queen<span class=\"No-Break\"> Takhisis.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Kleptocracy.</span></strong> This government is composed of groups or individuals primarily seeking wealth for themselves, often at the expense of their subjects. The grasping Bandit Kingdoms in the Greyhawk campaign setting are prime examples. A kingdom run by thieves’ guilds would also fall into this<span class=\"No-Break\"> category.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Magocracy.</span></strong> The governing body is composed of spellcasters who rule directly as oligarchs or feudal lords, or participate in a democracy or bureaucracy. Examples include the Red Wizards of Thay in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting and the sorcerer-kings of Athas in the Dark Sun campaig<span class=\"No-Break\">n setting.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Matriarchy or Patriarchy.</span></strong> This society is governed by the eldest or most important members of one gender. Drow cities are examples of theocratic matriarchies, for each is ruled by a council of drow high priestesses who answer to Lolth, the Demon Queen o<span class=\"No-Break\">f Spiders.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Meritocracy.</span></strong> The most intelligent and educated people oversee the society, often with a bureaucracy to handle the day-to-day work of government. In the Forgotten Realms, scholarly monks preside over the fortress-library of Candlekeep, overseen by a master of lore called t<span class=\"No-Break\">he Keeper.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Militocracy.</span></strong> Military leaders run the nation under martial law, using the army and other armed forces. A militocracy might be based on an elite group of soldiers, an order of dragon riders, or a league of sea princes. Solamnia, a nation ruled by knights in the Dragonlance campaign setting, falls into this<span class=\"No-Break\"> category.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Monarchy.</span></strong> A single hereditary sovereign wears the crown. Unlike the autocrat, the monarch’s powers are limited by law, and the ruler serves as the head of a democracy, feudal state, or militocracy. The kingdom of Breland, in the Eberron campaign setting, has both a parliament that makes laws and a monarch who enfo<span class=\"No-Break\">rces them.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Oligarchy.</span></strong> A small number of absolute rulers share power, possibly dividing the land into districts or provinces under their control, or jointly ruling together. A group of adventurers who take control of a nation together might form an oligarchy. The Free City of Greyhawk is an oligarchy composed of various faction leaders, with a Lord Mayor as its f<span class=\"No-Break\">igurehead.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Plutocracy.</span></strong> Society is governed by the wealthy. The elite form a ruling council, purchase representation at the court of a figurehead monarch, or rule by default because money is the true power in the realm. Many cities in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, including Waterdeep and Baldur’s Gate, are plu<span class=\"No-Break\">tocracies.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Republic.</span></strong> Government is entrusted to representatives of an established electorate who rule on behalf of the electors. Any democracy in which only landowners or certain classes can vote could be considered a<span class=\"No-Break\"> republic.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Satrapy.</span></strong> Conquerors and representatives of another government wield power, ruling the settlement or region as part of a larger empire. The satraps are bureaucrats and military officers, or unusual characters or monsters. The cities of Highport and Suderham in the Greyhawk campaign setting are satrapies controlled by agents of a vicious gang of marauders known as the Sl<span class=\"No-Break\">ave Lords.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Theocracy.</span></strong> Rulership falls to a direct representative or a collection of agents of a deity. The centers of power in a theocracy are usually located on sacred sites. In the Eberron campaign setting, the nation of Thrane is a theocracy devoted to the Silver Flame, a divine spirit that resides in Thrane’s capital of <span class=\"No-Break\">Flamekeep.</span></p><h4>Sample Hierarchy of Noble Titles</h4><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"compendium-short-table-header\">\n<p><strong>Rank</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p><strong>Title</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-6\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p>1st</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Emperor/Empress</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-7\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>2nd</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>King/Queen</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-6\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>3rd</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Duke/Duchess</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-7\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>4th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Prince/Princess</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-6\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>5th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Marquess/Marquise</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-12\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>6th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Earl or Count/Countess</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-13\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>7th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Viscount/Viscountess</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-7\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>8th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Baron/Baroness</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-6\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>9th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Baronet</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-7\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>10th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Knight</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h3>Commerce</h3><p>Even small villages can provide characters access to the gear they need to pursue their adventures. Provisions, tents, backpacks, and simple weapons are commonly available. Traveling merchants carry armor, martial weapons, and more specialized gear. Most villages have inns that cater to travelers, where adventurers can find a hot meal and a bed, even if the quality leaves much to b<span class=\"No-Break\">e desired.</span></p><p>Villages rely heavily on trade with other settlements, including larger towns and cities. Merchants pass through regularly, selling necessities and luxuries to the villagers, and any successful merchant has far-reaching contacts across the region. Traveling merchants pass on gossip and adventure hooks to the characters as they conduct their business. Since merchants make their living traversing roads that might be menaced by bandits or wandering monsters, they hire guards to keep their goods safe. They also carry news from town to town, including reports of situations that cry out for the attention of ad<span class=\"No-Break\">venturers.</span></p><p>These merchants can’t provide the services normally found in a city. For instance, when the characters are in need of a library or a dedicated sage, a trainer who can handle the griffon eggs they’ve found, or an architect to design their castle, they’re better off going to a large city than looking in <span class=\"No-Break\">a village.</span></p><h3>Currency</h3><p>The straightforward terms “gold piece” (gp), “silver piece” (sp), “copper piece” (cp), “electrum piece” (ep), and “platinum piece” (pp) are used throughout the game rules for clarity. You can imbue these denominations with more interesting descriptions in your game world. People give coins specific names, whether as plain as “dime” or lively as “gold double-eagle.” A country typically mints its own currency, which might correspond to the basic rules terms. In most worlds, few currencies achieve widespread distribution, but nearly all coins are accepted worldwide — except by those looking to pick a fight with a <span class=\"No-Break\">foreigner.</span></p><h4>Example: The Forgotten Realms</h4><p>The world of the Forgotten Realms provides an extensive example of currencies. Although barter, blood notes, and similar letters of trade are common enough in Faerûn, metal coins and trade bars are the everyday<span class=\"No-Break\"> currency.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/721/c51.png\"></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Common Coinage.</span></strong> Coins appear in a bewildering variety of shapes, sizes, names, and materials. Thanks to the ambitious traders of Sembia, that nation’s oddly shaped coins can be found throughout Faerûn. In Sembia, square iron steelpence replace copper coins. Triangular silver pieces are ravens, diamond-shaped electrum pieces are harmarks (commonly called “blue eyes”), and five-sided gold pieces are nobles. Sembia doesn’t mint platinum coins. All coinage is accepted in Sembia, including copper and platinum pieces fr<span class=\"No-Break\">om abroad.</span></p><p>In Waterdeep, the bustling cosmopolitan center of trade, coppers are called nibs, silvers are shards, electrum pieces are moons, gold pieces are dragons, and platinum coins are suns. The city’s two local coins are the toal and the harbor moon. The toal is a square brass trading-coin pierced with a central hole to permit it to be easily strung on a ring or string, worth 2 gp in the city and nothing outside Waterdeep. The harbor moon is a flat crescent of platinum with a central hole and an electrum inlay, named for its traditional use in the docks for buying large amounts of cargo at once. The coin is worth 50 gp in Waterdeep and 30 gp <span class=\"No-Break\">elsewhere.</span></p><p>The northern city of Silverymoon mints a crescent-shaped, shining blue coin called an electrum moon, worth 1 gp in that city and 1 ep elsewhere. The city also issues a larger coin called an eclipsed moon, which looks like an electrum moon combined a darker silver wedge to form a round coin worth 5 ep within the city and 2 ep o<span class=\"No-Break\">utside it.</span></p><p>The favored form of currency in the kingdom of Cormyr is the royal coinage of the court, stamped with a dragon on one side and a treasury date mark on the other. There, coppers are called thumbs, silvers are silver falcons, electrum pieces are blue eyes, gold pieces are golden lions, and platinum coins are <span class=\"No-Break\">tricrowns.</span></p><p>Even city-states mint their own copper, silver, and gold pieces. Electrum and platinum pieces are rarer in these lands. Smaller states use coinage borrowed from other nations and looted from ancient sources. Travelers from certain lands (notably the wizard-dominated realms of Thay and Halruaa) use the currencies of other realms when trading abroad because their own coins and tokens are feared to be magically cursed, and so are shunned <span class=\"No-Break\">by others.</span></p><p>Conversely, the coins of long-lost, legendary lands and centers of great magic are honored, though those who find them are wise to sell them to collectors rather than merely spending them in markets. The coins of the old elven court of Cormanthyr are particularly famous: thalvers (coppers), bedoars (silvers), thammarchs (electrum), shilmaers (golds), and ruendils (platinum). These coins are fine, numerous, and sometimes still used in trade am<span class=\"No-Break\">ong elves.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Trade Bars.</span></strong> Large numbers of coins can be difficult to transport and account for. Many merchants prefer to use trade bars — ingots of precious metals and alloys (usually silver) likely to be accepted by virtually anyone. Trade bars are stamped or graven with the symbol of the trading company or government that originally crafted them. These bars are valued by weight, a<span class=\"No-Break\">s follows:</span></p><ul>\n<li>A 2-pound silver bar is worth 10 gp and is about 5 inches long, 2 inches wide, and 1/2 i<span class=\"No-Break\">nch thick.</span></li>\n<li>A 5-pound silver bar is worth 25 gp and is about 6 inches long, 2 inches wide, and 1 i<span class=\"No-Break\">nch thick.</span></li>\n<li>A 5-pound gold bar is worth 250 gp and is about the size of a 2-pound s<span class=\"No-Break\">ilver bar.</span></li>\n</ul><p>The city of Baldur’s Gate mints large numbers of silver trade bars and sets the standard for this form of currency. The city of Mirabar issues black iron spindle-shaped trade bars with squared ends weighing about 2 pounds each, worth 10 gp in that city, markedly less in nearby trade centers, and as iron is normally valued elsewhere (1 sp p<span class=\"No-Break\">er pound).</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Odd Currency.</span></strong> Coins and bars aren’t the only forms of hard currency. Gond bells are small brass bells worth 10 gp in trade, or 20 gp to a temple of Gond. Shaar rings, pierced and polished slices of ivory threaded onto strings by the nomads of the Shaar, are worth 3 gp <span class=\"No-Break\">per slice.</span></p><h4>Creating Your Own</h4><p>As shown in the previous examples, currency doesn’t need to obey a universal standard in your world. Each country and era can have its own coins with its own values. Your adventurers might travel through many different lands and find long-lost treasures. Finding six hundred ancient bedoars from the rule of Coronal Eltargrim twelve centuries before offers a deeper sense of immersion in your world than find<span class=\"No-Break\">ing 60 sp.</span></p><p>Varying names and descriptions of coins for the major contemporary and historical realms of your world adds an additional layer of texture. The golden lions of Cormyr convey the noble nature of that kingdom. If a nation mints gold coins stamped with leering demonic faces and called torments, that currency expresses a distin<span class=\"No-Break\">ct flavor.</span></p><p>Creating new coins connected to specific locations, like the toals of Waterdeep or the eclipsed moons of Silverymoon, provides another level of detail. As long as you keep the value of these new coins simple (in other words, don’t invent a coin worth 1.62 gp), you add local flavor to key locations in your world without adding undue c<span class=\"No-Break\">omplexity.</span></p><h2>Languages and Dialects</h2><p>When fleshing out your world, you can create new languages and dialects to reflect its unique geography and history. You can replace the default languages presented in the <span class=\"italic\"><em>Player’s Handbook</em></span> with new ones, or split languages up into several different<span class=\"No-Break\"> dialects.</span></p><p>In some worlds, regional differences might be much more important than racial ones. Perhaps all the dwarves, elves, and humans who live in one kingdom speak a common language, which is completely different from that spoken in the neighboring kingdom. This might make communication (and diplomacy) between two kingdoms significantly more <span class=\"No-Break\">difficult.</span></p><p>Widely used languages might have ancient versions, or there might be completely different ancient tongues that adventurers find written in tombs and ruins. Such languages can add an element of mystery to inscriptions and tomes that characters <span class=\"No-Break\">encounter.</span></p><p>You might invent additional secret languages, besides Druidic and thieves’ cant, that allow members of certain organizations or political affiliations to communicate. You could even decide that each alignment has its own language, which might be more of an argot used primarily to discuss philosophical<span class=\"No-Break\"> concepts.</span></p><p>In a region where one race has subjugated another, the language of the conquerors can become a mark of social status. Similarly, reading and writing might be restricted by law to the upper classes of <span class=\"No-Break\">a society.</span></p><h2>Factions and Organizations</h2><p>Temples, guilds, orders, secret societies, and colleges are important forces in the social order of any civilization. Their influence might stretch across multiple towns and cities, with or without a similarly wide-ranging political authority. Organizations can play an important part in the lives of player characters, becoming their patrons, allies, or enemies just like individual nonplayer characters. When characters join these organizations, they become part of something larger than themselves, which can give their adventures a context in the wi<span class=\"No-Break\">der world.</span></p><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/806/c1-05.png\"></span></p><h3>Adventurers and Organizations</h3><p>At the start of a campaign, backgrounds are a great way to connect adventurers to your world. As the game progresses, though, background ties often become less <span class=\"No-Break\">important.</span></p><p>Factions and organizations aimed at player characters are a way to keep higher-level adventurers connected to your world, providing ties to key NPCs and a clear agenda beyond individual gain. In the same way, villainous organizations create an ongoing sense of menace above and beyond the threat of soli<span class=\"No-Break\">tary foes.</span></p><p>Having different characters tied to different factions can create interesting situations at the gaming table, as long as those factions have similar goals and don’t work in opposition to one another all the time. Adventurers representing different factions might have competing interests or priorities while they pursue the s<span class=\"No-Break\">ame goals.</span></p><p>Adventurer organizations are also a great source of special rewards beyond experience points and treasure. Increased standing in an organization has value in and of itself, and might also come with concrete benefits such as access to an organization’s information, equipment, magic, and other <span class=\"No-Break\">resources.</span></p><h4>Creating Factions</h4><p>Factions and organizations that you create for your campaign should grow out of the stories that are important to the world. Create organizations that your players will want to interact with, whether as allies, members, o<span class=\"No-Break\">r enemies.</span></p><p>As a starting point, decide what role you want an organization to play in the world. What is it all about? What are its goals? Who founded it and why? What do its members do? Answering these questions should give you a good sense of the organization’s personality. From there, think about typical members. How might people describe them? What are the typical members’ classes and alignments? What personality traits do they tend<span class=\"No-Break\"> to share?</span></p><p>Choosing a symbol and a motto for the organization is a way of summing up the work you’ve done so far. A faction that uses a stag as a symbol probably has a very different personality from one that uses a winged viper. For a motto, choose not just a message but also a tone and style of speech that fits the organization as you’ve defined it. Consider the motto of the Harpers: “Down with tyranny. Fairness and equality for all.” The Harpers have a straightforward message of freedom and prosperity. Contrast that with the motto of a group of politically allied cities in the North calling themselves the Lords’ Alliance: “Threats to home must be terminated without prejudice. Superiority is our security.” These are sophisticated people involved in a delicate political alliance, with more emphasis on stability than on fairness and<span class=\"No-Break\"> equality.</span></p><p>Finally, think about the ways that player characters might come into contact with the organization. Who are the important members — not just the leaders, but the agents in the field that the adventurers might encounter? Where are they active, and where do they have headquarters or strongholds? If adventurers do join, what kind of missions might they be sent on? What rewards can <span class=\"No-Break\">they gain?</span></p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>SAMPLE FACTION: THE HARPERS</strong></p>\n<p>The Harpers is a scattered network of spellcasters and spies who advocate equality and covertly oppose the abuse of power, magical or <span class=\"No-Break\">otherwise.</span></p>\n<p>The organization has risen, been shattered, and risen again several times. Its longevity and resilience are largely due to its decentralized, grassroots, secretive nature, and the autonomy of its various members. The Harpers have small cells and lone operatives throughout the Forgotten Realms, although they interact and share information with one another from time to time as needs warrant. The Harpers’ ideology is noble, and its members pride themselves on their ingenuity and incorruptibility. Harpers don’t seek power or glory, only fair and equal treatmen<span class=\"No-Break\">t for all.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Italic-Sans-Serif\"><em>Motto</em>.</span></strong> “Down with tyranny. Fairness and equality<span class=\"No-Break\"> for all.”</span></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Italic-Sans-Serif\"><em>Beliefs.</em></span></strong> The Harpers’ beliefs can be summarized a<span class=\"No-Break\">s follows:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>One can never have too much information or arcane <span class=\"No-Break\">knowledge.</span></li>\n<li>Too much power leads to corruption, and the abuse of magic in particular must be closely <span class=\"No-Break\">monitored.</span></li>\n<li>No one should be <span class=\"No-Break\">powerless.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Italic-Sans-Serif\"><em>Goals.</em></span></strong> Gather information throughout Faerûn, discern the political dynamics within each region, and promote fairness and equality by covert means. Act openly as a last resort. Thwart tyrants and any leader, government, or group that grows too powerful. Aid the weak, the poor, and the <span class=\"No-Break\">oppressed.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Italic-Sans-Serif\"><em>Typical Quests.</em></span></strong> Typical Harper quests include securing an artifact that would upset the balance of power in a region, gathering information on a powerful individual or organization, and determining the true intentions of an ambitious political figure or evil sp<span class=\"No-Break\">ellcaster.</span></p>\n</blockquote><h3>Renown</h3><p>Renown is an optional rule you can use to track an adventurer’s standing within a particular faction or organization. Renown is a numerical value that starts at 0, then increases as a character earns favor and reputation within a particular organization. You can tie benefits to a character’s renown, including ranks and titles within the organization and access to <span class=\"No-Break\">resources.</span></p><p>A player tracks renown separately for each organization his or her character is a member of. For example, an adventurer might have 5 renown within one faction and 20 renown within another, based on the character’s interaction with each organization over the course of the<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><h4>Gaining Renown</h4><p>A character earns renown by completing missions or quests that serve an organization’s interests or involve the organization directly. You award renown at your discretion as characters complete these missions or quests, typically at the same time you award experien<span class=\"No-Break\">ce points.</span></p><p>Advancing an organization’s interests increases a character’s renown within that organization by 1. Completing a mission specifically assigned by that organization, or which directly benefits the organization, increases the character’s renown by <span class=\"No-Break\">2 instead.</span></p><p>For example, characters with connections to the noble Order of the Gauntlet complete a mission in which they free a town from the tyranny of a blue dragon. Because the order likes to punish evildoers, you might increase each character’s renown within the order by 1. Conversely, if killing the dragon was a mission given to the adventurers by a senior member of the order, completing the task might instead increase each character’s renown by 2, showing the adventurers as effecti<span class=\"No-Break\">ve allies.</span></p><p>Meanwhile, the party’s rogue might have looted a box of rare poisons from the dragon’s hoard and sold it to a fence who is secretly a Zhentarim agent. You might increase the rogue’s renown within the Zhentarim by 2 since this action directly increased that group’s power and wealth, even though the task was not assigned by an agent of the <span class=\"No-Break\">Zhentarim.</span></p><h4>Examples of Faction Ranks</h4><div><table id=\"table012\" class=\"compendium-table-auto-width\"><colgroup> </colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"compendium-short-table-header\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p><strong>Renown</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p><strong>Harpers</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p><strong>Order of the Gauntlet</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p><strong>Emerald Enclave</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p><strong>Lord’s Alliance</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p><strong>Zhentarim</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-6\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p>1</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Watcher</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Chevall</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Springwarden</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Cloak</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Fang</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-7\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>3</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Harpshadow</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Marcheon</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Summerstrider</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Redknife</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Wolf</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-6\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>10</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Brightcandle</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Whitehawk</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Autumnreaver</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Stingblade</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Viper</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-7\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>25</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Wise Owl</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Vindicator</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Winterstalker</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Warduke</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Ardragon</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-6\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p>50</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>High Harper</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Righteous Hand</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Master of the Wild</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Lioncrown</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Dread Lord</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h4>Benefits of Renown</h4><p>The benefits of increasing renown within an organization can include rank and authority, friendly attitudes from members of the organization, and ot<span class=\"No-Break\">her perks.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Rank.</span></strong> Characters can earn promotions as their renown increases. You can establish certain thresholds of renown that serve as prerequisites (though not necessarily the only prerequisites) for advancing in rank, as shown in the Examples of Faction Ranks table. For example, a character might join the Lords’ Alliance after earning 1 renown within that organization, gaining the title of cloak. As the character’s renown within the organization increases, he or she might be eligible for further increase<span class=\"No-Break\">s in rank.</span></p><p>You can add rank prerequisites. For example, a character affiliated with the Lords’ Alliance might have to be at least 5th level before becoming a stingblade, at least 10th level to be a warduke, and at least 15th level to be a <span class=\"No-Break\">lioncrown.</span></p><p>You can set these thresholds of renown to any numbers that work for your game, creating appropriate ranks and titles for the organizations in your<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Attitudes of Organization Members.</span></strong> As a character’s renown within an organization grows, members of that organization are increasingly likely to have heard of the character. You can set thresholds at which the default attitude of an organization’s members toward the character becomes indifferent or friendly. For example, members of the Emerald Enclave — a faction dedicated to preserving the natural order — might be less friendly toward characters who have not cultivated at least 3 renown within that organization, becoming friendly by default only when a character has gained 10 renown within the Emerald Enclave. These thresholds apply only to the default attitude of most members of an organization, and such attitudes aren’t automatic. NPC faction members might dislike an adventurer despite that character’s renown — or perhaps beca<span class=\"No-Break\">use of it.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Perks</span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">.</span></strong> Earning a rank within an organization comes with certain benefits, as defined by you. A character of low rank might gain access to a reliable contact and adventure leads, a safe house, or a trader willing to offer a discount on adventuring gear. A middle-ranked character might gain a follower (see chapter 4, “<a title=\"Creating Nonplayer Characters\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters\">Creating Nonplayer Characters</a>”), access to potions and scrolls, the ability to call in a favor, or backup on dangerous missions. A high-ranking character might be able to call on a small army, take custody of a rare magic item, gain access to a helpful spellcaster, or assign special missions to members of l<span class=\"No-Break\">ower rank.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Downtime Activities.</span></strong> You might allow characters to spend downtime between adventures building relationships and gaining renown within an organization. For more information on downtime activities, see chapter 6, “<a title=\"Between Adventures\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/between-adventures\">Between Ad</a><span class=\"No-Break\"><a title=\"Between Adventures\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/between-adventures\">ventures</a>.”</span></p><h4>Losing Renown</h4><p>Disagreements with members of an organization aren’t enough to cause a loss of renown within that organization. However, serious offenses committed against the organization or its members can result in a loss of renown and rank within the organization. The extent of the loss depends on the infraction and is left to your discretion. A character’s renown within an organization can never dro<span class=\"No-Break\">p below 0.</span></p><h4>Piety</h4><p>With a few alterations, the renown system can also serve as a measure of a character’s link to the gods. It’s a great option for campaigns where the gods take active roles in <span class=\"No-Break\">the world.</span></p><p>Using this approach, you track renown based on specific divine figures in your campaign. Each character has the option to select a patron deity or pantheon with goals, doctrine, and taboos that you have created. Any renown he or she earns is called piety. A character gains piety for honoring his or her gods, fulfilling their commands, and respecting their taboos. A character loses piety for working against those gods, dishonoring them, defiling their temples, and foiling t<span class=\"No-Break\">heir aims.</span></p><p>The gods bestow favors on those who prove their devotion. With each rank of piety gained, a character can pray for divine favor once per day. This favor usually comes in the form of a cleric spell like <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/bless\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"bless\">bless</a></span>. The favor often comes with a sign of the divine benefactor; for example, a character dedicated to Thor might receive a spell accompanied by the boom o<span class=\"No-Break\">f thunder.</span></p><p>A high level of piety can also lead to a character gaining a more persistent benefit, in the form of a blessing or charm (see chapter 7, “<a title=\"Treasure\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/treasure\">Treasure</a>” for such supernatur<span class=\"No-Break\">al gifts).</span></p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>SAMPLE FACTION: THE ZHENTARIM</strong></p>\n<p>The Zhentarim (also known as the Black Network) is an unscrupulous shadow network that seeks to expand its influence and power throughout the Forgott<span class=\"No-Break\">en Realms.</span></p>\n<p>The public face of the Black Network appears relatively benign. It offers the best and cheapest goods and services, both legal and illicit, thus destroying its competitors and making everyone depend<span class=\"No-Break\">ent on it.</span></p>\n<p>A member of the Zhentarim thinks of himself or herself as a member of a very large family and relies on the Black Network for resources and security. However, members are granted the autonomy to pursue their own interests and gain some measure of personal wealth and influence. As a whole, the Zhentarim promises “the best of the best,” although in truth the organization is more interested in spreading its own propaganda and influence than investing in the improvement of its individua<span class=\"No-Break\">l members.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Italic-Sans-Serif\"><em>Motto.</em></span></strong> “Join us and prosper.

People everywhere know about magic, and most people see evidence of it at some point in their lives. It permeates the cosmos and moves through the ancient possessions of legendary heroes, the mysterious ruins of fallen empires, those touched by the gods, creatures born with supernatural power, and individuals who study the secrets of the multiverse. Histories and fireside tales are filled with the exploits of those who<span class=\"No-Break\"> wield it.</span></p><p>What normal folk know of magic depends on where they live and whether they know characters who practice magic. Citizens of an isolated hamlet might not have seen true magic used for generations and speak in whispers of the strange powers of the old hermit living in the nearby woods. In the city of Waterdeep in the Forgotten Realms setting, the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors is a guild of wizards. These arcanists wish to make wizardry more accessible so the order’s members can profit from selling their<span class=\"No-Break\"> services.</span></p><p>Some D&amp;D settings have more magic in them than others. On Athas, the harsh world of the Dark Sun setting, arcane magic is a hated practice that can drain life from the world. Much of Athas’s magic lies in the hands of evildoers. Conversely, in the world of Eberron, magic is as commonplace as any other commodity. Mercantile houses sell magic items and services to anyone who can afford them. People purchase tickets to ride airships and trains propelled by elemen<span class=\"No-Break\">tal magic.</span></p><p>Consider these questions when fitting magic into y<span class=\"No-Break\">our world:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Is some magic common? Is some socially unacceptable? Which magi<span class=\"No-Break\">c is rare?</span></li>\n<li>How unusual are members of each spellcasting class? How common are those who can cast high-lev<span class=\"No-Break\">el spells?</span></li>\n<li>How rare are magic items, magical locations, and creatures that have supernatural powers? At what power level do these things go from everyday <span class=\"No-Break\">to exotic?</span></li>\n<li>How do authorities regulate and use magic? How do normal folks use magic and protect themselve<span class=\"No-Break\">s from it?</span></li>\n</ul><p>The answers to some questions suggest the answers to others. For example, if spellcasters of low-level spells are common, as in Eberron, then authorities and common folk are more likely to have access to and use the results of such spells. Buying commonplace magic isn’t only possible, but also less expensive. People are more likely to keep well-known magic in mind, and to protect against it, especially in risky s<span class=\"No-Break\">ituations.</span></p><h3>Restrictions on Magic</h3><p>Some civilized areas might restrict or prohibit the use of magic. Spellcasting might be forbidden without a license or official permission. In such a place, magic items and continual magical effects are rare, with protections against magic being the <span class=\"No-Break\">exception.</span></p><p>Some localities might prohibit specific spells. It could be a crime to cast any spells used to steal or swindle, such as those that bestow invisibility or produce illusions. Enchantments that charm or dominate others are readily outlawed, since they rob their subjects of free will. Destructive spells are likewise prohibited, for obvious reasons. A local ruler could have a phobia about a specific effect or spell (such as shapeshifting effects if he or she were afraid of being impersonated) and enact a law restricting that type<span class=\"No-Break\"> of magic.</span></p><h3>Schools of Magic</h3><p>The rules of the game refer to the schools of magic (abjuration, illusion, necromancy, and so on), but it’s up to you to determine what those schools signify in your world. Similarly, a few class options suggest the existence of magic-using organizations in the world — bardic colleges and druid circles — which are up to you to <span class=\"No-Break\">flesh out.</span></p><p>You could decide that no formal structures like these exist in your world. Wizards (and bards and druids) might be so rare that a player character learns from a single mentor and never meets another character of the same class, in which case wizards would learn their school specialization without any formal<span class=\"No-Break\"> training.</span></p><p>However, if magic is more common, academies can be the embodiments of the schools of magic. These institutions have their own hierarchies, traditions, regulations, and procedures. For example, Materros the necromancer could be a brother of the necromantic Cabal of Thar-Zad. As a sign of his high standing within its hierarchy, he is allowed to wear the red and green robes of a master. Of course, when he wears these robes, his occupation is easily identified by those who know of the cabal. This recognition could be a boon or a nuisance, since the Cabal of Thar-Zad has a fearsome r<span class=\"No-Break\">eputation.</span></p><p>If you go this route, you can treat schools of magic, bardic colleges, and druid circles as organizations, using the guidelines for organizations presented earlier in this chapter. A player character necromancer might cultivate renown within the Cabal of Thar-Zad, while a bard seeks increasing renown within the College of Mac<span class=\"No-Break\">-Fuirmidh.</span></p><h3>Teleportation Circles</h3><p>The presence of permanent teleportation circles in major cities helps cement their important place in the economy of a fantasy world. Spells such as <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"plane shift\">plane shift</a></span>, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/teleport\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"teleport\">teleport</a></span>, and <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/teleportation-circle\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"teleportation circle\">teleportation circle</a></span> connect with these circles, which are found in temples, academies, the headquarters of arcane organizations, and prominent civic locations. However, since every teleportation circle is a possible means of entry into a city, they’re guarded by military and magical p<span class=\"No-Break\">rotection.</span></p><p>As you design a fantasy city, think about the teleportation circles it might contain and which ones adventurers are likely to know about. If the adventurers commonly return to their home base by means of a teleportation circle, use that circle as a hook for plot developments in your campaign. What do the adventurers do if they arrive in a teleportation circle and find all the familiar wards disabled and guards lying in pools of blood? What if their arrival interrupts an argument between two feuding priests at the temple? Adventu<span class=\"No-Break\">re ensues!</span></p><h3>Bringing Back the Dead</h3><p>When a creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves the Material Plane, travels through the Astral Plane, and goes to abide on the plane where the creature’s deity resides. If the creature didn’t worship a deity, its soul departs to the plane corresponding to its alignment. Bringing someone back from the dead means retrieving the soul from that plane and returning it to<span class=\"No-Break\"> its body.</span></p><p>Enemies can take steps to make it more difficult for a character to be returned from the dead. Keeping the body prevents others from using <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/raise-dead\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"raise dead\">raise dead</a></span> or <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/resurrection\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"resurrection\">resurrection</a></span> to restore the slain characte<span class=\"No-Break\">r to life.</span></p><p>A soul can’t be returned to life if it doesn’t wish to be. A soul knows the name, alignment, and patron deity (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and might refuse to return on that basis. For example, if the honorable knight Sturm Brightblade is slain and a high priestess of Takhisis (god of evil dragons) grabs his body, Sturm might not wish to be raised from the dead by her. Any attempts she makes to revive him automatically fail. If the evil cleric wants to revive Sturm to interrogate him, she needs to find some way to trick his soul, such as duping a good cleric into raising him and then capturing him once he is al<span class=\"No-Break\">ive again.</span></p><h2>Creating a Campaign</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/807/c1-06.png\"></p><p>The world you create is the stage for the adventures you set in it. You don’t have to give more thought to it than that. You can run adventures in an episodic format, with the characters as the only common element, and also weave themes throughout those adventures to build a greater saga of the characters’ achievements in <span class=\"No-Break\">the world.</span></p><p>Planning an entire campaign might seem like a daunting task, but you don’t have to plot out every detail right from the start. You can start with the basics, running a few adventures, and think about larger plotlines you want to explore as the campaign progresses. You’re free to add as much or as little detail as<span class=\"No-Break\"> you wish.</span></p><p>The start of a campaign resembles the start of an adventure. You want to jump quickly into the action, show the players that adventure awaits, and grab their attention right away. Give the players enough information to make them want to come back week after week to see how the story <span class=\"No-Break\">plays out.</span></p><h3>Start Small</h3><p>When you first start building your campaign, start small. The characters need to know only about the city, town, or village where they start the game, and perhaps the nearby dungeon. You might decide that the barony is at war with a nearby duchy, or that a distant forest is crawling with ettercaps and giant spiders, and you should note these things. But at the start of the game, the local area is enough to get the campaign off the ground. Follow these steps to create that l<span class=\"No-Break\">ocal area:</span></p><h4>1. Create a Home Base</h4><p>See the “<a title=\"Settlements\" href=\"#Settlements\">Settlements</a>” section earlier in this chapter for guidance on building this settlement. A small town or village at the edge of the wilderness serves as a fine home base in most D&amp;D campaigns. Use a larger town or city if you want a campaign with urban ad<span class=\"No-Break\">venturing.</span></p><h4>2. Create a Local Region</h4><p>See “<a title=\"Mapping the Campaign\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/a-world-of-your-own#MappingYourCampaign\">Mapping the Campaign</a>” earlier in this chapter for guidance. Draw a map at province scale (1&nbsp;hex&nbsp;= 1 mile) with the home base near the center. Fill in the area within a day’s travel — about 25 to 30 miles — of the home base. Pepper it with two to four dungeons or similar adventure locales. An area that size is likely to have one to three additional settlements as well as the home base, so give thought to the<span class=\"No-Break\">m as well.</span></p><h4>3. Craft a Starting Adventure</h4><p>A single dungeon makes a good first adventure for most campaigns. See chapter 3, “<a title=\"Creating Adventures\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-adventures\">Creating Adventures</a>” for<span class=\"No-Break\"> guidance.</span></p><p>A home base provides a common starting location for the characters. This starting point might be the village where they grew up or a city that attracted them from points beyond. Or perhaps they begin the campaign in the dungeons of an evil baron’s castle where they’ve been locked up for various reasons (legitimate or otherwise), throwing them into the midst of the <span class=\"No-Break\">adventure.</span></p><p>For each of these steps, give the locations only as much detail as they need. You don’t need to identify every building in a village or label every street in a large city. If the characters start in the baron’s dungeon, you’ll need the details of this first adventure site, but you don’t have to name all the baron’s knights. Sketch out a simple map, think about the surrounding area, and consider whom the characters are most likely to interact with early in the campaign. Most important, visualize how this area fits into the theme and story you have in mind for your campaign. Then start working on your first <span class=\"No-Break\">adventure!</span></p><h3>Set the Stage</h3><p>As you start to develop your campaign, you’ll need to fill in the players on the basics. For easy distribution, compile essential information into a campaign handout. Such a handout typically includes the following<span class=\"No-Break\"> material:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Any restrictions or new options for character creation, such as new or prohibi<span class=\"No-Break\">ted races.</span></li>\n<li>Any information in the backstory of your campaign that the characters would know about. If you have a theme or direction in mind for the campaign, this information could include seeds hinting at t<span class=\"No-Break\">hat focus.</span></li>\n<li>Basic information about the area where the characters are starting, such as the name of the town, important locations in and around it, prominent NPCs they’d know about, and perhaps rumors that point to trouble that’<span class=\"No-Break\">s brewing.</span></li>\n</ul><p>Keep this handout short and to the point. Two pages is a reasonable maximum. Even if you have a burst of creative energy that produces twenty pages of great background material, save it for your adventures. Let the players uncover the details graduall<span class=\"No-Break\">y in play.</span></p><h3>Involving the Characters</h3><p>Once you’ve identified what your campaign is about, let the players help tell the story by deciding how their characters are involved. This is their opportunity to tie their characters’ history and background to the campaign, and a chance for you to determine how the various elements of each character’s background tie into the campaign’s story. For example, what secret has the hermit character learned? What is the status of the noble character’s family? What is the folk hero’<span class=\"No-Break\">s destiny?</span></p><p>Some players might have trouble coming up with ideas — not everyone is equally inventive. You can help spur their creativity with a few questions about their c<span class=\"No-Break\">haracters:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Are you a native, born and raised in the area? If so, who’s your family? What’s your current o<span class=\"No-Break\">ccupation?</span></li>\n<li>Are you a recent arrival? Where did you come from? Why did you come to <span class=\"No-Break\">this area?</span></li>\n<li>Are you tied to any of the organizations or people involved in the events that kick off the campaign? Are they friends o<span class=\"No-Break\">r enemies?</span></li>\n</ul><p>Listen to the players’ ideas, and say yes if you can. Even if you want all the characters to have grown up in the starting town, consider allowing a recent arrival or a transplant if the player’s story is convincing enough. Suggest alterations to a character’s story so it better fits your world, or weave the first threads of your campaign into t<span class=\"No-Break\">hat story.</span></p><h3>Creating a Background</h3><p>Backgrounds are designed to root player characters in the world, and creating new backgrounds is a great way to introduce players to the special features of your world. Backgrounds that have ties to particular cultures, organizations, and historical events from your campaign are particularly strong. Perhaps the priests of a certain religion live as beggars supported by a pious populace, singing the tales of their deity’s exploits to entertain and enlighten the faithful. You could create a mendicant priest background (or modify the acolyte background) to reflect these qualities. It could include musical instrument proficiency, and its feature probably involves receiving hospitality from the<span class=\"No-Break\"> faithful.</span></p><p>Guidelines for creating a new background are provided in chapter 9, “<a title=\"Dungeon Master's Workshop\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop\">Dungeon Master’s Workshop</a>.”</p><h2>Campaign Events</h2><p>Significant events in the history of a fantasy world tend toward immense upheavals: wars that pit the forces of good against evil in an epic confrontation, natural disasters that lay waste to entire civilizations, invasions of vast armies or extraplanar hordes, assassinations of world leaders. These world-shaking events title the chapters o<span class=\"No-Break\">f history.</span></p><p>In a D&amp;D game, such events provide the sparks that can ignite and sustain a campaign. The most common pitfall of serial stories without a set beginning, middle, and end is inertia. Like many television shows and comic-book series, a D&amp;D campaign runs the risk of retreading the same ground long after the enjoyment’s gone. Just as actors or writers drift away from those other mediums, so can players — the actors and writers of a D&amp;D game. Games stagnate when the story meanders too long without a change in tone, when the same villains and similar adventures grow tiresome and predictable, and when the world doesn’t change around the characters and in response to thei<span class=\"No-Break\">r actions.</span></p><p>World-shaking events force conflict. They set new events and power groups in motion. Their outcomes change the world by altering the tone of the setting in a meaningful way. They chronicle the story of your world in big, bold print. Change — especially change that occurs as a result of the characters’ actions — keeps the story moving. If change is imperceptible, the actions of the characters lack significance. When the world becomes reliable, it’s time to shake <span class=\"No-Break\">things up.</span></p><h3>Putting Events in Motion</h3><p>World-shaking events can happen at any time in a campaign or story arc, but the biggest incidents naturally fall at the beginning, middle, and end o<span class=\"No-Break\">f a story.</span></p><p>That placement reflects the structure of dramatic stories. At the beginning of a story, something happens to shake the protagonists’ world and spur them into action. The characters take action to resolve their problems, but other forces oppose them. As they reach a significant milestone toward their goal, a major conflict disrupts the characters’ plans, shaking their world again; failure seems imminent. At the end of the story, they succeed or fail, and the world is shaken again by the way the characters changed it for go<span class=\"No-Break\">od or ill.</span></p><p>At the beginning of a D&amp;D campaign, world-shaking events create instant adventure hooks and affect the characters’ lives directly. In the middle, they make great turning points as the characters’ fortunes reverse — rising after a defeat or falling after a victory. Near the end of a campaign, such events serve as excellent climactic episodes with far-reaching effects. They might even occur after the story has ended, as a result of the characters<span class=\"No-Break\">’ actions.</span></p><h3>When Not to Shake It Up</h3><p>In constructing a narrative, beware of “false action,” or action for its own sake. False action doesn’t move a story forward, engage characters, or cause them to change. Many action movies suffer from false action, in which car chases, gunfights, and explosions abound but do little more than inconvenience the characters and eventually bore the audience with their repetition and dearth of meaningful stakes. Some D&amp;D campaigns fall into the same trap, stringing world-spanning disasters together one after another with little impact on the characters or the world. Thus, it’s probably not in the DM’s best interest to reorder the world every single time there’s a lull in the action, lest world-shaking events become<span class=\"No-Break\"> ordinary.</span></p><p>As a general rule, a campaign can sustain up to three large-scale, world-shaking events: one near the beginning, one near the middle, and one near the end. Use as many small-scale events that disturb the bounded microcosms of towns, villages, tribes, fiefs, duchies, provinces, and so forth as you like. Every significant event shakes someone’s world, after all, no matter how small that world might be. Let unexpected and terrible events regularly afflict the world’s smaller territories, but unless your story demands it, save the large-scale map-spanning events for the biggest, most important moments of your<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><h3>World-Shaking Events</h3><p>You can use this section for ideas and inspiration to expand on world-shaking events already occurring (or soon to occur) within your world. Alternatively, you can roll on the tables below to randomly generate an event to inspire your imagination. The attempt to justify a random result can reveal unforeseen poss<span class=\"No-Break\">ibilities.</span></p><p>To get started, select a world-shaking event category or roll on the World-Shaking Eve<span class=\"No-Break\">nts table.</span></p><h4>World-Shaking Events</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"867967878\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[GOn9OoeeBOufAuJM]{Event}</span></div></div></div><h4>1-2. Rise or Fall of a Leader or an Era</h4><p>Eras are often defined by the prominent leaders, innovators, and tyrants of the day. These people change the world and etch their signatures indelibly on the pages of history. When they rise to power, they shape the time and place where they live in monumental ways. When they fall from power or pass away, the ghost of their presenc<span class=\"No-Break\">e lingers.</span></p><p>Determine the kind of leader that influences the new or passing era. You can choose the type of leader or determine one randomly using the Leader Ty<span class=\"No-Break\">pes table.</span></p><h4>Leader Types</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1570157278\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[o7zOlqCESUKkxRat]{Leader Type}</span></div></div></div><p>Political leaders are monarchs, nobles, and chiefs. Religious leaders include deities’ avatars, high priests, and messiahs, as well as those in charge of monasteries and leaders of influential religious sects. Major military leaders control the armed forces of countries. They include military dictators, warlords, and the heads of a ruler’s war council. Minor military leaders include the heads of local militias, gangs, and other martial organizations. At the broadest scale, a criminal or underworld leader wields power through a network of spies, bribes, and black-market trade. On the smallest scale, these are local gang bosses, pirate captains, and brigands. A leader in art or culture is a virtuoso whose work reflects the spirit of the age and changes the way people think: a prominent playwright, bard, or court fool in whose words, art, or performance the people perceive universal truth. On a smaller scale, this might be an influential local poet, minstrel, satirist, or sculptor. A major leader in philosophy, learning, or magic is a genius philosopher, a counselor to emperors, an enlightened thinker, the head of the highest institution of learning in the world, or an archmage. A minor leader might be a local sage, seer, hedge wizard, wise elder, o<span class=\"No-Break\">r teacher.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\"><em>Rise of a Leader, Beginning of an Era.</em> </span></strong>In dramatic stories, a new leader’s rise often comes at the end of a period of struggle or turmoil. Sometimes it’s a war or uprising; other times it’s an election, the death of a tyrant, a prophecy fulfilled, or the appointment of a hero. Conversely, the new leader might be a tyrant, a fiend, or black-hearted villain, and the era that just ended could have been one of peace, tranquility, an<span class=\"No-Break\">d justice.</span></p><p>A new leader shakes the foundations of your campaign world and begins a new era in the selected region. How does this person or this era begin to affect the world? Here are several things to consider when determining the leader’s impact on <span class=\"No-Break\">the world:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Name one thing that has been consistently true about the world, which is now no longer true due to this leader’s rise or influence. This is the biggest change that occurs when the new leader takes power and becomes the prevailing trait that defines the era, the characteristic for which it is r<span class=\"No-Break\">emembered.</span></li>\n<li>Name the person (or people) whose death, defeat, or loss opened the door for this leader to take power. This might be a military defeat, the overthrow of old ideas, a cultural rebirth, or something else. Who died, lost, or was defeated? What weren’t they willing to compromise? Was the new leader complicit in the death, defeat, or loss, or was the opportunity sere<span class=\"No-Break\">ndipitous?</span></li>\n<li>Despite the leader’s virtues, one flaw in particular outrages a certain segment of the populace. What is that flaw? What person or group of persons will do their utmost to foil this leader because of it? Conversely, what is this leader’s greatest virtue, and who rises to the leader’s defense beca<span class=\"No-Break\">use of it?</span></li>\n<li>Who believes in this leader now, but still retains doubts? This is someone close to the leader, who has the leader’s trust and knows his or her secret fears, doubts,<span class=\"No-Break\"> or vices.</span></li>\n</ul><p><strong><span class=\"italic\"><em>Fall of a Leader, End of an Era.</em> </span></strong>All that begins must end. With the fall of kings and queens, the maps of the world are redrawn. Laws change, new customs become all the rage, and old ones fall out of favor. The attitude of the citizens toward their fallen leader shifts subtly at first and then changes dramatically as they look back or reminisce about the ti<span class=\"No-Break\">me before.</span></p><p>The fallen leader might have been a benevolent ruler, an influential citizen, or even an adversary to the characters. How does the death of this person affect those formerly under his or her influence? Here are several things to consider when determining the effects of a leader’<span class=\"No-Break\">s passing:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Name one positive change that the leader brought to his or her domain or sphere of influence. Does that change persist after the leade<span class=\"No-Break\">r’s death?</span></li>\n<li>State the general mood or attitude of the people under this person’s power. What important fact didn’t they realize about this person or his or her reign, which will later come<span class=\"No-Break\"> to light?</span></li>\n<li>Name one person or group that tries to fill the leader’s shoes in the resulting pow<span class=\"No-Break\">er vacuum.</span></li>\n<li>Name one person or group that plotted against th<span class=\"No-Break\">is leader.</span></li>\n<li>Name three things for which this leader will be r<span class=\"No-Break\">emembered.</span></li>\n</ul><h4>3. Cataclysmic Disaster</h4><p>Earthquake, famine, fire, plague, flood — disasters on a grand scale can eradicate whole civilizations without warning. Natural (or magical) catastrophes redraw maps, destroy economies, and alter worlds. Sometimes the survivors rebuild from the ruins. The Great Chicago Fire, for instance, provided an opportunity to rebuild the city according to a modern plan. Most of the time the disaster leaves only ruins — buried under ash like Pompeii, or sunk beneath the waves like<span class=\"No-Break\"> Atlantis.</span></p><p>You can choose the cataclysm or determine one randomly using the Cataclysmic Disast<span class=\"No-Break\">ers table.</span></p><h4>Cataclysmic Disasters</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-38404329\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[IgJQ7k6Pvqzpt3wU]{Cataclysmic Disaster}</span></div></div></div><p>Some of the disasters on the table might not make immediate sense in the context of your campaign world. A flood in the desert? A volcanic eruption on grassy plains? If you randomly determine a disaster that conflicts with your setting, you can reroll, but the challenge of justifying the catastrophe can produce interestin<span class=\"No-Break\">g results.</span></p><p>With two exceptions, the disasters on the table resemble those that affect our own world. Think of planar warps and magic gone awry like nuclear incidents; they’re big events that unnaturally alter the land and its people. For example, in the Eberron campaign setting, a magical catastrophe lays waste to an entire country, transforming it into a hostile wasteland and ending the<span class=\"No-Break\"> Last War.</span></p><p>Divine judgment is something else entirely. This disaster takes whatever form you want, but it’s always a big, bold, unsubtle sign of a deity’s di<span class=\"No-Break\">spleasure.</span></p><p>You might decide to wipe a town, region, or nation off the map of your world. A disaster ravages the land and effectively eliminates a place the characters once knew. Leave one or two survivors to tell the characters what happened, and ensure that the characters feel the depth of the catastrophe. What are the ongoing effects of this cataclysm? The following points can help you define the nature and consequences of the<span class=\"No-Break\"> disaster:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Decide what caused this cataclysm and where it o<span class=\"No-Break\">riginated.</span></li>\n<li>An omen presaged this event, or a series of signs and omens. Describe the omen <span class=\"No-Break\">in detail.</span></li>\n<li>Describe or name the creature that warned the populace about the oncoming disaster. Who<span class=\"No-Break\"> listened?</span></li>\n<li>Who were the lucky (or unlucky) ones who<span class=\"No-Break\"> survived?</span></li>\n<li>Describe what the area looks like after the disaster, in contrast to how it look<span class=\"No-Break\">ed before.</span></li>\n</ul><h4>4. Assault or Invasion</h4><p>One of the most common world-shaking events, an invasion occurs when one group forcibly takes over another, usually by military strength, but also by infiltration and o<span class=\"No-Break\">ccupation.</span></p><p>An assault differs from an invasion in that the attacking force isn’t necessarily interested in occupation or taking power. On the other hand, an assault might be the first step of an<span class=\"No-Break\"> invasion.</span></p><p>Regardless of the scale, a world-shaking assault or invasion stands out because its repercussions change the characters’ world, and its effects echo long after the initial attack or<span class=\"No-Break\"> takeover.</span></p><p>Imagine that part of your campaign world is attacked or invaded. Depending on the current scale of your campaign, the area might be as small as a section of a city or as large as a continent, world, or plane of <span class=\"No-Break\">existence.</span></p><p>Define the aggressor and whether it represents a known enemy or a previously unknown adversary. Select a threat that already poses a danger to the area you’ve chosen, or use the Invading Forces table to determine the <span class=\"No-Break\">aggressor.</span></p><h4>Invading Forces</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1713265498\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[Zhj1PlJNsxEV0vIu]{Invading Force}</span></div></div></div><p>Now consider these other aspects of the<span class=\"No-Break\"> conflict:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Name one element of the invasion or assault that the defenders didn’t expect or could<span class=\"No-Break\">n’t repel.</span></li>\n<li>Something happened to the first defenders who stood against the invasion or assault — something no one wants to talk about. Wh<span class=\"No-Break\">at was it?</span></li>\n<li>The attackers or invaders had a motive for their action that wasn’t obvious or understood at first. Wh<span class=\"No-Break\">at was it?</span></li>\n<li>Who turned traitor, and at what point did they turn? Why did they do it? Did an attacker try to stop the incursion, or did a prominent defender throw in with the<span class=\"No-Break\"> invaders?</span></li>\n</ul><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/808/c1-07.png\"></p><h4>5. Rebellion, Revolution, Overthrow</h4><p>Dissatisfied with the current order, a person or group of people overturns the dominant regime and takes over — or fails to take over. Regardless of the result, a revolution (even an attempted one) can shape the destiny o<span class=\"No-Break\">f nations.</span></p><p>The scale of a revolution need not involve the common masses against the nobility. A revolution can be as small as a merchants’ guild revolting against its leadership or a temple overthrowing its priesthood in favor of a new creed. The spirits of the forest might attempt to overthrow the forces of civilization in a nearby city that cut down trees for timber. Alternatively, the scale can be as dramatic as humanity rising to overthrow<span class=\"No-Break\"> the gods.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/809/c1-08.png\"></p><p>Imagine that part of your campaign world erupts in revolution. Pick a power group in your current campaign and name (or invent) a group that opposes it, fomenting revolution. Then let the following points help you flesh out the<span class=\"No-Break\"> conflict:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Name three things the rebels want or hope t<span class=\"No-Break\">o achieve.</span></li>\n<li>The rebels achieve a victory against those they wish to overthrow, even if it’s a pyrrhic victory. Which of their three goals do they achieve? How long is this achievement likel<span class=\"No-Break\">y to last?</span></li>\n<li>State the cost exacted upon the old order after its fall from power. Does anyone from the former power group remain in power during the next regime? If the old order remains in power, describe one way that its leaders punish the revolu<span class=\"No-Break\">tionaries.</span></li>\n<li>One of the rebellion’s prominent leaders — in some respects the face of the revolution — was driven by a personal reason for his or her part in events. Describe this person and state the true reason he or she led the <span class=\"No-Break\">rebellion.</span></li>\n<li>What problem existed before the revolution that persists in sp<span class=\"No-Break\">ite of it?</span></li>\n</ul><h4>6. Extinction or Depletion</h4><p>Something that once existed in the campaign world is gone. The lost resource might be a precious metal, a species of plant or animal that held an important place in the local ecology, or an entire race or culture of people. Its absence causes a chain reaction that affects every creature that uses or rel<span class=\"No-Break\">ies on it.</span></p><p>You can eliminate a people, place, or thing that previously existed in a certain location or area in your campaign world. On a small scale, the last of a family dynasty passes away or a once-thriving mining town in the region dries up and becomes a ghost town. On a grand scale, magic dies, the last dragon is slain, or the final fey noble departs <span class=\"No-Break\">the world.</span></p><p>What is gone from the world — or the region of the world you’ve chosen — that once existed there? If the answer isn’t immediately evident, consult the Extinction or Depletion table <span class=\"No-Break\">for ideas.</span></p><h4>Extinction or Depletion</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1642698518\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[LOwz8DtkkT1Aw7Mc]{Lost Resource}</span></div></div></div><p>Then consider these additional <span class=\"No-Break\">questions:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Name a territory, race, or type of creature that relied on the thing that was lost. How do they compensate? How do they attempt to substitute for what<span class=\"No-Break\"> was lost?</span></li>\n<li>Who or what is to blame for<span class=\"No-Break\"> the loss?</span></li>\n<li>Describe an immediate consequence of the loss. Forecast one way that the loss impacts or changes the world in the long term. Who or what suffers the most as a result of the loss? Who or what benefits the mos<span class=\"No-Break\">t from it?</span></li>\n</ul><h4>7. New Organization</h4><p>The foundation of a new order, kingdom, religion, society, cabal, or cult can shake the world with its actions, doctrine, dogma, and policies. On a local scale, a new organization contends with existing power groups, influencing, subverting, dominating, or allying with them to create a stronger base of power. Large and powerful organizations can exert enough influence to rule the world. Some new organizations benefit the populace, while others grow to threaten the civilization they once <span class=\"No-Break\">protected.</span></p><p>Perhaps an important new organization arises in one part of your world. It could have humble or auspicious beginnings, but one thing is certain: it is destined to change the world as long as it progresses along its present course. Sometimes an organization’s alignment is apparent from inception, but its morality can remain ambiguous until its doctrines, policies, and traditions are revealed over time. Choose the type of organization, or use the New Organizations table to gener<span class=\"No-Break\">ate ideas.</span></p><h4>New Organizations</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1732761392\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[fRRQaApHCy9bRmsh]{New Organization}</span></div></div></div><p>Then consider some or all of the followin<span class=\"No-Break\">g options:</span></p><ul>\n<li>The new order supplants a current power group in the world, gaining territory, converts, or defectors and reducing the previous power group’s numbers. Who or what does the foundation of this new order<span class=\"No-Break\"> supplant?</span></li>\n<li>The new order appeals to a specific audience. Decide whether this order attracts a certain race, social class, or charac<span class=\"No-Break\">ter class.</span></li>\n<li>The leader of this new order is known for a particular quality valued by his or her followers. Elaborate on why they respect him or her for this quality, and what actions this leader has taken to retain the followers<span class=\"No-Break\">’ support.</span></li>\n<li>A rival group opposes the foundation of this new organization. Choose an existing power group from your campaign to oppose the new organization, or create one from the categories on the table. Decide why they oppose the new group, who leads them, and what they plan to do to stop th<span class=\"No-Break\">eir rival.</span></li>\n</ul><h4>8. Discovery, Expansion, Invention</h4><p>Discoveries of new lands expand the map and change the boundaries of empires. Discoveries of new magic or technology expand the boundaries of what was once thought possible. New resources or archaeological finds create opportunity and wealth and set prospectors and power groups in motion to vie for thei<span class=\"No-Break\">r control.</span></p><p>A new discovery — or rediscovery — can impact your campaign world in a meaningful way, shaping the course of history and the events of the age. Think of this discovery as a big adventure hook or series of hooks. This is also an opportunity to create a unique monster, item, god, plane, or race for your world. As long as the discovery matters, it doesn’t have to be wholly original, just flavored for your<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><p>A discovery is particularly impressive when the adventurers in your campaign are the ones who make it. If they discover a new mineral with magical properties, map a new land that’s eminently suitable for colonization, or uncover an ancient weapon with the power to wreak devastation on your world, they are likely to set major events in motion. This gives the players the opportunity to see exactly how much influence their actions have on y<span class=\"No-Break\">our world.</span></p><p>Decide on the type of discovery that is made or use the Discoveries table to gener<span class=\"No-Break\">ate ideas.</span></p><h4>Discoveries</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"431659940\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[BqhRISXMp3QCSKDJ]{Discovery}</span></div></div></div><p>Once you have determined the type of discovery, flesh it out by deciding exactly what it is, who discovered it, and what potential effect it could have on the world. Ideally, previous adventures in your campaign will help you fill in the blanks, but also keep the followin<span class=\"No-Break\">g in mind:</span></p><ul>\n<li>This discovery benefits a particular person, group, or faction more than others. Who benefits most? Name three benefits they stand to gain from this <span class=\"No-Break\">discovery.</span></li>\n<li>This discovery directly harms another person, group, or faction. Who is harmed<span class=\"No-Break\"> the most?</span></li>\n<li>This discovery has consequences. Name three repercussions or side effects. Who ignores the repe<span class=\"No-Break\">rcussions?</span></li>\n<li>Name two or three individuals or factions struggling to possess or control this discovery. Who is likely to win? What do they stand to gain, and what are they willing to do to control the <span class=\"No-Break\">discovery?</span></li>\n</ul><h4>9. Prediction, Omen, Prophecy</h4><p>Sometimes the foretelling of a world-shaking event becomes a world-shaking event: an omen that predicts the fall of empires, the doom of races, and the end of the world. Sometimes an omen points to change for the good, such as the arrival of a legendary hero or savior. But the most dramatic prophecies warn of future tragedies and predict dark ages. Unlike other world-shaking events, the outcome doesn’t happen immediately. Instead, individuals or factions strive to fulfill or avert the prophecy — or shape the exact way it will be fulfilled — according to how it will affect them. The prophecy’s helpers or hinderers create adventure hooks in the campaign by the actions they take. A prophecy should foretell a big event on a grand scale, since it will take time to come true (or be<span class=\"No-Break\"> averted).</span></p><p>Imagine that a world-shaking prophecy comes to light. If events continue on their present course, the prophecy will come true and the world will change dramatically as a result. Don’t shy away from making this prophecy both significant and alarming, keeping in mind the followi<span class=\"No-Break\">ng points:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Create a prophecy that foretells a major change to the campaign world. You can build one from scratch using ideas from the current campaign or randomly determine a world-shaking event and flesh out th<span class=\"No-Break\">e details.</span></li>\n<li>Write a list of three or more omens that will occur before the prophecy comes to pass. You can use events that have already occurred in the campaign so that the prophecy is closer to being fulfilled. The rest are events that might or might not happen, depending on the actions of the c<span class=\"No-Break\">haracters.</span></li>\n<li>Describe the person or creature that discovered the prophecy and how it was found. What did this creature gain by revealing it? What did this person lose or <span class=\"No-Break\">sacrifice?</span></li>\n<li>Describe the individual or faction that supports the prophecy and works to ensure its fulfillment, and the one that will do all in its power to avert the prophecy. What is the first step each takes? Who suffers for thei<span class=\"No-Break\">r efforts?</span></li>\n<li>One part of the prophecy is wrong. Choose one of the omens you listed or one of the details you created for the world-shaking event that the omen predicts. The chosen omen is false, and if applicable, its opposite is tru<span class=\"No-Break\">e instead.</span></li>\n</ul><h4>10. Myth and Legend</h4><p>If wars, plagues, discoveries, and the like can be called regular world-shaking events, mythic events exceed and surpass them. A mythic event might occur as the fulfillment of an ancient or long-forgotten prophecy, or it might be an act of divine int<span class=\"No-Break\">ervention.</span></p><p>Once again, your current campaign probably provides a few ideas for the shape of this event. If you need inspiration, roll a d8 on the World-Shaking Events table, instead of the normal d10. Address the bullet-point notes for that disaster, but magnify the result to the grandest scale you ca<span class=\"No-Break\">n imagine.</span></p><p>The rise or fall of a leader or era is the death or birth of a god, or the end of an age or the world. A cataclysmic disaster is a world-drowning deluge, an ice age, or a zombie apocalypse. An assault or invasion is a world war, a world-spanning demonic incursion, the awakening of a world-threatening monster, or the final clash between good and evil. A rebellion dethrones a god or gods, or raises a new force (such as a demon lord) to divinity. A new organization is a world-spanning empire or a pantheon of new gods. A discovery is a doomsday device or a portal to eldritch dimensions where world-shattering cosmic horr<span class=\"No-Break\">ors dwell.</span></p><h3>Tracking Time</h3><p>A calendar lets you record the passage of time in the campaign. More importantly, it lets you plan ahead for the critical events that shake up the world. For simple time tracking, use a calendar for the current year in the real world. Pick a date to indicate the start of the campaign, and make note of the days that adventurers spend on their travels and various activities. The calendar tells you when the seasons change and the lunar cycle. More importantly, you can use your calendar to track important festivals and holidays, as well as key events that shape your<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><p>This method is a good starting point, but the calendar of your world need not follow a modern calendar. If you want to customize your calendar with details unique to your world, consider these types of<span class=\"No-Break\"> features.</span></p><h4>The Basics</h4><p>A fantasy world’s calendar doesn’t have to mirror the modern one, but it can (see “The Calendar of Harptos” sidebar for an example). Do the weeks of a month have names? What about specific days of each month, like the ides, nones, and calends of the Roman<span class=\"No-Break\"> calendar?</span></p><h4>Physical Cycles</h4><p>Determine when the seasons fall, marked by the solstices and equinoxes. Do the months correspond to the phases of the moon (or moons)? Do strange and magical effects occur at the same time as these <span class=\"No-Break\">phenomena?</span></p><h4>Religious Observances</h4><p>Sprinkle holy days throughout your calendar. Each significant deity in your world should have at least one holy day during the year, and some gods’ holy days correspond to celestial phenomena such as new moons or equinoxes. Holy days reflect the portfolio of a deity (a god of agriculture is honored in the harvest season) or significant events in the history of the deity’s worship, such as the birth or death of a holy person, the date of a god’s manifestation, the accession of the current high priest, <span class=\"No-Break\">and so on.</span></p><p>Certain holy days are civic events, observed by every citizen of a town where a god’s temple can be found. Harvest festivals are often celebrations on a grand scale. Other holy days are important only to people particularly devoted to a single deity. Still others are observed by priests, who perform private rites and sacrifices inside their temples on certain days or specific times of day. And some holy days are local, observed by the faithful of a specif<span class=\"No-Break\">ic temple.</span></p><p>Give some thought to how priests and common folk celebrate holy days. Going into a temple, sitting in a pew, and listening to a sermon is a mode of worship foreign to most fantasy religions. More commonly, celebrants offer sacrifices to their gods. The faithful bring animals to the temple to be slaughtered or burn incense as an offering. The wealthiest citizens bring the largest animals, to flaunt their wealth and demonstrate their piety. People pour out libations at the graves of their ancestors. They spend all-night vigils in darkened shrines or enjoy splendid feasts celebrating a god<span class=\"No-Break\">’s bounty.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/810/c1-09.png\"></p><h4>Civic Observances</h4><p>Holy days provide the majority of the special celebrations in most calendars, but local or national festivals account for many others. The birthday of a monarch, the anniversary of a great victory in a war, craft festivals, market days, and similar events all provide excuses for local cel<span class=\"No-Break\">ebrations.</span></p><h4>Fantastic Events</h4><p>Since your setting is a fantasy world and not a mundane medieval society, add in a few events of an obviously magical nature. For example, perhaps a ghostly castle appears on a certain hill on the winter solstice every year, or every third full moon fills lycanthropes with a particularly strong bloodlust. Also, the thirteenth night of every month could mark the ghostly wanderings of a long-forgotten noma<span class=\"No-Break\">dic tribe.</span></p><p>Extraordinary events, such as the approach of a comet or a lunar eclipse, make good adventure elements, and you can drop them in your calendar wherever you want. Your calendar can tell you when there’s a full moon for a lunar eclipse, but you can always fudge the date for a particul<span class=\"No-Break\">ar effect.</span></p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>THE CALENDAR OF HARPTOS</strong></p>\n<p>The world of the Forgotten Realms uses the Calendar of Harptos, named after the long-dead wizard who invented it. Each year of 365 days is divided into twelve months of thirty days each, which roughly correspond to months in the real-world Gregorian calendar. Each month is divided into three tendays. Five special holidays fall between the months and mark the seasons. Another special holiday, Shieldmeet, is inserted into the calendar after Midsummer every four years, much like leap years in the modern Gregorian calendar.</p>\n<div

Campaign</h3><p>A campaign’s ending should tie up all the threads of its beginning and middle, but you don’t have to take a campaign all the way to 20th level for it to be satisfying. Wrap up the campaign whenever your story reaches its natural c<span class=\"No-Break\">onclusion.</span></p><p>Make sure you allow space and time near the end of your campaign for the characters to finish up any personal goals. Their own stories need to end in a satisfying way, just as the campaign story does. Ideally, some of the characters’ individual goals will be fulfilled by the ultimate goal of the final adventure. Give characters with unfinished goals a chance to finish them before the<span class=\"No-Break\"> very end.</span></p><p>Once the campaign has ended, a new one can begin. If you intend to run a new campaign for the same group of players, using their previous characters’ actions as the basis of legends gives them immediate investment in the new setting. Let the new characters experience how the world has changed because of their old characters. In the end, though, the new campaign is a new story with new protagonists. They shouldn’t have to share the spotlight with the heroes of day<span class=\"No-Break\">s gone by.</span></p><h2>Play Style</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/811/c1-10.png\"></p><p>By building a new world (or adopting an existing one) and creating the key events that launch your campaign, you determined what your campaign is about. Next, you have to decide how you want to run your<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><p>What’s the right way to run a campaign? That depends on your play style and the motivations of your players. Consider your players’ tastes, your strengths as a DM, table rules (discussed in part 3), and the type of game you want to run. Describe to the players how you envision the game experience and let them give you input. The game is theirs, too. Lay that groundwork early, so your players can make informed choices and help you maintain the type of game you wa<span class=\"No-Break\">nt to run.</span></p><p>Consider the following two exaggerated examples of p<span class=\"No-Break\">lay style.</span></p><h3>Hack and Slash</h3><p>The adventurers kick in the dungeon door, fight the monsters, and grab the treasure. This style of play is straightforward, fun, exciting, and action-oriented. The players spend relatively little time developing personas for their characters, roleplaying noncombat situations, or discussing anything other than the immediate dangers of th<span class=\"No-Break\">e dungeon.</span></p><p>In such a game, the adventurers face clearly evil monsters and opponents and occasionally meet clearly good and helpful NPCs. Don’t expect the adventurers to anguish over what to do with prisoners, or to debate whether it’s right or wrong to invade and wipe out a bugbear lair. Don’t track money or time spent in town. Once they’ve completed a task, send the adventurers back into the action as quickly as possible. Character motivation need be no more developed than a desire to kill monsters and acquire<span class=\"No-Break\"> treasure.</span></p><h3>Immersive Storytelling</h3><p>Waterdeep is threatened by political turmoil. The adventurers must convince the Masked Lords, the city’s secret rulers, to resolve their differences, but can do so only after both the characters and the lords have come to terms with their differing outlooks and agendas. This style of gaming is deep, complex, and challenging. The focus isn’t on combat but on negotiations, political maneuverings, and character interaction. A whole game session might pass without a single at<span class=\"No-Break\">tack roll.</span></p><p>In this style of game, the NPCs are as complex and richly detailed as the adventurers, although the focus lies on motivation and personality, not game statistics. Expect long digressions from each player about what his or her character does, and why. Going to a temple to ask a priest for advice can be as important an encounter as fighting orcs. (And don’t expect the adventurers to fight the orcs at all unless they are motivated to do so.) A character will sometimes take actions against the player’s better judgment, because “that’s what the character <span class=\"No-Break\">would do.”</span></p><p>Since combat isn’t the focus, game rules take a back seat to character development. Ability check modifiers and skill proficiencies take precedence over combat bonuses. Feel free to change or ignore rules to fit the players’ roleplaying needs, using the advice presented in part 3 of <span class=\"No-Break\">this book.</span></p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>A WORLD TO EXPLORE</strong></p>\n<p>Much of a campaign involves the adventurers traveling from place to place, exploring the environment, and learning about the fantasy world. This exploration can take place in any environment, including a vast wilderness, a labyrinthine dungeon, the shadowy passages of the Underdark, the crowded streets of a city, and the undulating waters of the sea. Determining a way around an obstacle, finding a hidden object, investigating a strange feature of a dungeon, deciphering clues, solving puzzles, and bypassing or disabling traps can all be part of ex<span class=\"No-Break\">ploration.</span></p>\n<p>Sometimes exploration is an incidental part of the game. For instance, you might gloss over an unimportant journey by telling the players that they spend three uneventful days on the road before moving along to the next point of interest. Other times exploration is the focus, a chance to describe a wondrous part of the world or story that increases the players’ feeling of immersion. Similarly, you should consider playing up exploration if your players enjoy solving puzzles, finding their way around obstacles, and searching dungeon corridors for sec<span class=\"No-Break\">ret doors.</span></p>\n</blockquote><h3>Something in Between</h3><p>The style of play in most campaigns falls between these two extremes. There’s plenty of action, but the campaign offers an ongoing storyline and interaction between characters as well. Players develop their characters’ motivations and relish the chance to prove their skills in combat. To maintain the balance, provide a mixture of roleplaying encounters and combat encounters. Even in a dungeon setting, you can present NPCs that aren’t meant to be fought but rather helped out, negotiated with, or just <span class=\"No-Break\">talked to.</span></p><p>Think about your preferred style of play by considering these <span class=\"No-Break\">questions:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Are you a fan of realism and gritty consequences, or are you more focused on making the game seem like an act<span class=\"No-Break\">ion movie?</span></li>\n<li>Do you want the game to maintain a sense of medieval fantasy, or do you want to explore alternate time lines or modern<span class=\"No-Break\"> thinking?</span></li>\n<li>Do you want to maintain a serious tone, or is humor <span class=\"No-Break\">your goal?</span></li>\n<li>Even if you are serious, is the action lighthearted o<span class=\"No-Break\">r intense?</span></li>\n<li>Is bold action key, or do the players need to be thoughtful and<span class=\"No-Break\"> cautious?</span></li>\n<li>Do you like to plan thoroughly in advance, or do you prefer improvising on<span class=\"No-Break\"> the spot?</span></li>\n<li>Is the game full of varied D&amp;D elements, or does it center on a theme such <span class=\"No-Break\">as horror?</span></li>\n<li>Is the game for all ages, or does it involve matu<span class=\"No-Break\">re themes?</span></li>\n<li>Are you comfortable with moral ambiguity, such as allowing the characters to explore whether the end justifies the means? Or are you happier with straightforward heroic principles, such as justice, sacrifice, and helping the do<span class=\"No-Break\">wntrodden?</span></li>\n</ul><h3>Character Names</h3><p>Part of your campaign style has to do with naming characters. It’s a good idea to establish some ground rules with your players at the start of a new campaign. In a group consisting of Sithis, Travok, Anastrianna, and Kairon, the human fighter named Bob II sticks out, especially when he’s identical to Bob I, who was killed by kobolds. If everyone takes a lighthearted approach to names, that’s fine. If the group would rather take the characters and their names a little more seriously, urge Bob’s player to come up with a more appropr<span class=\"No-Break\">iate name.</span></p><p>Player character names should match each other in flavor or concept, and they should also match the flavor of your campaign world — so should the nonplayer characters’ names and place names you create. Travok and Kairon don’t want to undertake a quest for Lord Cupcake, visit Gumdrop Island, or take down a crazy wizard <span class=\"No-Break\">named Ray.</span></p><h3>Continuing or Episodic Campaigns</h3><p>The backbone of a campaign is a connected series of adventures, but you can connect them in two diffe<span class=\"No-Break\">rent ways.</span></p><p>In a continuing campaign, the connected adventures share a sense of a larger purpose or a recurring theme (or themes). The adventures might feature returning villains, grand conspiracies, or a single mastermind who’s ultimately behind every adventure of the<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><p>A continuing campaign designed with a theme and a story arc in mind can feel like a great fantasy epic. The players derive the satisfaction of knowing the actions they take during one adventure matter in the next. Plotting and running that kind of campaign can be demanding on the DM, but the payoff is a great and memora<span class=\"No-Break\">ble story.</span></p><p>An episodic campaign, in contrast, is like a television show where each week’s episode is a self-contained story that doesn’t play into any overarching plot. It might be built on a premise that explains its nature: the player characters are adventurers-for-hire, or explorers venturing into the unknown and facing a string of unrelated dangers. They might even be archaeologists, venturing into one ancient ruin after another in search of artifacts. An episodic game like this lets you create adventures — or buy published ones — and drop them into your campaign without worrying about how they fit with the adventures that came before and fol<span class=\"No-Break\">low after.</span></p><h3>Campaign Theme</h3><p>A theme in a campaign, as in a work of literature, expresses the deeper meaning of a story and the fundamental elements of human experience that the story explores. Your campaign doesn’t have to be a work of literature, but it can still draw on common themes that lend a distinctive flavor to its stories. Consider these<span class=\"No-Break\"> examples:</span></p><ul>\n<li>A campaign about confronting the inevitability of mortality, whether embodied in undead monsters or expressed through the death of l<span class=\"No-Break\">oved ones.</span></li>\n<li>A campaign revolving around an insidious evil, whether dark gods, monstrous races such as the yuan-ti, or creatures of unknown realms far removed from mortal concerns. As heroes confront this evil, they must face the selfish, cold tendencies of their own kin<span class=\"No-Break\">d as well.</span></li>\n<li>A campaign featuring troubled heroes who confront not only the savagery of the bestial creatures of the world, but also the beast within — the rage and fury that lies in their o<span class=\"No-Break\">wn hearts.</span></li>\n<li>A campaign exploring the insatiable thirst for power and domination, whether embodied by the hosts of the Nine Hells or by humanoid rulers bent on conquering <span class=\"No-Break\">the world.</span></li>\n</ul><p>With a theme such as “confrontation with mortality,” you can craft a broad range of adventures that aren’t necessarily connected by a common villain. One adventure might feature the dead bursting from their graves and threatening to overwhelm a whole town. In the next adventure, a mad wizard creates a flesh golem in an effort to revive his lost love. A villain could go to extreme lengths to achieve immortality to avoid confronting its own demise. The adventurers might help a ghost accept death and move on, or one of the adventurers might even becom<span class=\"No-Break\">e a ghost!</span></p><h4>Variations on a Theme</h4><p>Mixing things up once in a while allows your players to enjoy a variety of adventures. Even a tightly themed campaign can stray now and then. If your campaign heavily involves intrigue, mystery, and roleplaying, your players might enjoy the occasional dungeon crawl — especially if the tangent is revealed to relate to a larger plot in the campaign. If most of your adventures are dungeon expeditions, shift gears with a tense urban mystery that eventually leads the party into a dungeon crawl in an abandoned building or tower. If you run horror adventures week after week, try using a villain who turns out to be ordinary, perhaps even silly. Comic relief is a great variation on almost any D&amp;D campaign, though players usually provide it t<span class=\"No-Break\">hemselves.</span></p><h2>Tiers of Play</h2><p>As characters grow in power, their ability to change the world around them grows with them. It helps to think ahead when creating your campaign to account for this change. As the characters make a greater impact on the world, they face greater danger whether they want to or not. Powerful factions see them as a threat and plot against them, while friendly ones court their favor in hopes of striking a useful<span class=\"No-Break\"> alliance.</span></p><p>The tiers of play represent the ideal milestones for introducing new world-shaking events to the campaign. As the characters resolve one event, a new danger arises or the prior trouble transforms into a new threat in response to the characters’ actions. Events need to grow in magnitude and scope, increasing the stakes and drama as the characters become increasingly powerful. This approach also allows you to break your design work down into smaller pieces. Create material such as adventures, NPCs, maps, and so on for one tier at a time. You only need to worry about the details of the next tier as the characters approach it. Even better, as the campaign takes unexpected turns in response to the players’ choices, you don’t have to worry about redoing <span class=\"No-Break\">much work.</span></p><h3>Levels 1-4: Local Heroes</h3><p>Characters in this tier are still learning the range of class features that define them, including their choice of specialization. But even 1st-level characters are heroes, set apart from the common people by natural characteristics, learned skills, and the hint of a greater destiny that lies be<span class=\"No-Break\">fore them.</span></p><p>At the start of their careers, characters use 1st- and 2nd-level spells and wield mundane gear. The magic items they find include common consumable items (potions and scrolls) and a very few uncommon permanent items. Their magic can have a big impact in a single encounter, but it doesn’t change the course of an <span class=\"No-Break\">adventure.</span></p><p>The fate of a village might hang on the success or failure of low-level adventurers, who trust their lives to their fledgling abilities. These characters navigate dangerous terrain and explore haunted crypts, where they can expect to fight savage orcs, ferocious wolves, giant spiders, evil cultists, bloodthirsty ghouls, and hired thugs. If they face even a young dragon, they’re better off avoidin<span class=\"No-Break\">g a fight.</span></p><h3>Levels 5-10: Heroes of the Realm</h3><p>By the time they reach this tier, adventurers have mastered the basics of their class features, though they continue to improve throughout these levels. They have found their place in the world and have begun to involve themselves in the dangers that surr<span class=\"No-Break\">ound them.</span></p><p>Dedicated spellcasters learn 3rd-level spells at the start of this tier. Suddenly characters can fly, damage large numbers of foes with <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"fireball\">fireball</a></span> and <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lightning-bolt\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"lightning bolt\">lightning bolt</a></span> spells, and even breathe underwater. They master 5th-level spells by the end of the tier, and spells such as <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/teleportation-circle\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"teleportation circle\">teleportation circle</a></span>, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scrying\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"scrying\">scrying</a></span>, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/flame-strike\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"flame strike\">flame strike</a></span>, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/legend-lore\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"legend lore\">legend lore</a></span>, and <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/raise-dead\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"raise dead\">raise dead</a></span> can have a significant impact on their adventures. They start acquiring more permanent magic items (uncommon and rare ones) as well, which will serve them for the rest of thei<span class=\"No-Break\">r careers.</span></p><p>The fate of a region might depend on the adventures that characters of levels 5 to 10 undertake. These adventurers venture into fearsome wilds and ancient ruins, where they confront savage giants, ferocious hydras, fearless golems, evil yuan-ti, scheming devils, bloodthirsty demons, crafty mind flayers, and drow assassins. They might have a chance of defeating a young dragon that has established a lair but not yet extended its reach far into the surrounding <span class=\"No-Break\">territory.</span></p><h3>Levels 11-16: Masters of the Realm</h3><p>By 11th level, characters are shining examples of courage and determination — true paragons in the world, set well apart from the masses. At this tier, adventurers are far more versatile than they were at lower levels, and they can usually find the right tool for a given <span class=\"No-Break\">challenge.</span></p><p>Dedicated spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells at 11th level, including spells that completely change the way adventurers interact with the world. Their big, flashy spells are significant in combat — <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/disintegrate\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"disintegrate\">disintegrate</a></span>, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/blade-barrier\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"blade barrier\">blade barrier</a></span>, and <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/heal\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"heal\">heal</a></span>, for example — but behind-the-scenes spells such as <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/word-of-recall\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"word of recall\">word of recall</a></span>, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/find-the-path\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"find the path\">find the path</a></span>, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/contingency\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"contingency\">contingency</a></span>, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/teleport\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"teleport\">teleport</a></span>, and <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/true-seeing\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"true seeing\">true seeing</a></span> alter the way players approach their adventures. Each spell level after that point introduces new effects with an equally large impact. The adventurers find rare magic items (and very rare ones) that bestow similarly powerful <span class=\"No-Break\">abilities.</span></p><p>The fate of a nation or even the world depends on momentous quests that such characters undertake. Adventurers explore uncharted regions and delve into long-forgotten dungeons, where they confront terrible masterminds of the lower planes, cunning rakshasas and beholders, and hungry purple worms. They might encounter and even defeat a powerful adult dragon that has established a lair and a significant presence in <span class=\"No-Break\">the world.</span></p><p>At this tier, adventurers make their mark on the world in a variety of ways, from the consequences of their adventures to the manner in which they spend their hard-won treasure and exploit their well-deserved reputations. Characters of this level construct fortresses on land deeded them by local rulers. They found guilds, temples, or martial orders. They take on apprentices or students of their own. They broker peace between nations or lead them into war. And their formidable reputations attract the attention of very powe<span class=\"No-Break\">rful foes.</span></p><h3>Levels 17-20: Masters of the World</h3><p>By 17th level, characters have superheroic capabilities, and their deeds and adventures are the stuff of legend. Ordinary people can hardly dream of such heights of power — or such terribl<span class=\"No-Break\">e dangers.</span></p><p>Dedicated spellcasters at this tier wield earthshaking 9th-level spells such as<span class=\"italic\"> <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wish\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"wish\">wish</a></span>, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gate\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"gate\">gate</a></span>, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/storm-of-vengeance\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"storm of vengeance\">storm of vengeance</a></span>, and <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/astral-projection\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"astral projection\">astral projection</a>.</span> Characters have several rare and very rare magic items at their disposal, and begin discovering legendary items such as a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/vorpal-sword\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"vorpal sword\">vorpal sword</a> </span>or a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/staff-of-the-magi\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"staff of the magi\">staff of the magi</a>.</span></p><p>Adventures at these levels have far-reaching consequences, possibly determining the fate of millions in the Material Plane and even places beyond. Characters traverse otherworldly realms and explore demiplanes and other extraplanar locales, where they fight savage balor demons, titans, archdevils, lich archmages, and even avatars of the gods themselves. The dragons they encounter are wyrms of tremendous power, whose sleep troubles kingdoms and whose waking threatens existen<span class=\"No-Break\">ce itself.</span></p><p>Characters who reach 20th level have attained the pinnacle of mortal achievement. Their deeds are recorded in the annals of history and recounted by bards for centuries. Their ultimate destinies come to pass. A cleric might be taken up into the heavens to serve as a god’s right hand. A warlock could become a patron to other warlocks. Perhaps a wizard unlocks the secret to immortality (or undeath) and spends eons exploring the farthest reaches of the multiverse. A druid might become one with the land, transforming into a nature spirit of a particular place or an aspect of the wild. Other characters could found clans or dynasties that revere the memory of their honored ancestors from generation to generation, create masterpieces of epic literature that are sung and retold for thousands of years, or establish guilds or orders that keep the adventurers’ principles and dre<span class=\"No-Break\">ams alive.</span></p><p>Reaching this point doesn’t necessarily dictate the end of the campaign. These powerful characters might be called on to undertake grand adventures on the cosmic stage. And as a result of these adventures, their capabilities can continue to evolve.

Many different flavors of fantasy exist in fiction and film. Do you want a horrific campaign inspired by the works of H. P. Lovecraft or Clark Ashton Smith? Or do you envision a world of muscled barbarians and nimble thieves, along the lines of the classic sword-and-sorcery books by Robert E. Howard and Fritz Leiber? Your choice can have a impact on the flavor of your<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><h3>Heroic Fantasy</h3><p>Heroic fantasy is the baseline assumed by the D&amp;D rules. The<span class=\"italic\"> <em>Player’s Handbook</em></span> describes this baseline: a multitude of humanoid races coexist with humans in fantastic worlds. Adventurers bring magical powers to bear against the monstrous threats they face. These characters typically come from ordinary backgrounds, but something impels them into an adventuring life. The adventurers are the “heroes” of the campaign, but they might not be truly heroic, instead pursuing this life for selfish reasons. Technology and society are based on medieval norms, though the culture isn’t necessarily European. Campaigns often revolve around delving into ancient dungeons in search of treasure or in an effort to destroy monsters or<span class=\"No-Break\"> villains.</span></p><p>This genre is also common in fantasy fiction. Most novels set in the Forgotten Realms are best described as heroic fantasy, following in the footsteps of many of the authors listed in the <a title=\"Inspirational Reading\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/appendix-e-inspirational-reading\">Appendices</a>&nbsp;of the <span class=\"italic\">Player’s</span><span class=\"No-Break\"><span class=\"italic\"> Handbook.</span></span></p><h3>Sword and Sorcery</h3><p>A grim, hulking fighter disembowels the high priest of the serpent god on his own altar. A laughing rogue spends ill-gotten gains on cheap wine in filthy taverns. Hardy adventurers venture into the unexplored jungle in search of the fabled City of Gol<span class=\"No-Break\">den Masks.</span></p><p>A sword-and-sorcery campaign emulates some of the classic works of fantasy fiction, a tradition that goes back to the roots of the game. Here you’ll find a dark, gritty world of evil sorcerers and decadent cities, where the protagonists are motivated more by greed and self-interest than by altruistic virtue. Fighter, rogue, and barbarian characters tend to be far more common than wizards, clerics, or paladins. In such a pulp fantasy setting, those who wield magic often symbolize the decadence and corruption of civilization, and wizards are the classic villains of these settings. Magic items are therefore rare and often <span class=\"No-Break\">dangerous.</span></p><p>Certain <span class=\"caps\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span> novels follow in the footsteps of classic sword-and-sorcery novels. The world of Athas (as featured in numerous Dark Sun novels and game products), with its heroic gladiators and tyrannical sorcerer-kings, belongs squarely in t<span class=\"No-Break\">his genre.</span></p><h3>Epic Fantasy</h3><p>A devout paladin in gleaming plate armor braces her lance as she charges a dragon. Bidding farewell to his dear love, a noble wizard sets forth on a quest to close the gate to the Nine Hells that has opened in the remote wilderness. A close-knit band of loyal friends strives to overcome the forces of a tyrannical<span class=\"No-Break\"> overlord.</span></p><p>An epic-fantasy campaign emphasizes the conflict between good and evil as a prominent element of the game, with the adventurers more or less squarely on the side of good. These characters are heroes in the best sense, driven by a higher purpose than selfish gain or ambition, and facing incredible dangers without blinking. Characters might struggle with moral quandaries, fighting the evil tendencies within themselves as well as the evil that threatens the world. And the stories of these campaigns often include an element of romance: tragic affairs between star-crossed lovers, passion that transcends even death, and chaste adoration between devout knights and the monarchs and nobles t<span class=\"No-Break\">hey serve.</span></p><p>The novels of the Dragonlance saga exemplify the tradition of epic fanta<span class=\"No-Break\">sy in D&amp;D.</span></p><h3>Mythic Fantasy</h3><p>While an angry god tries time and again to destroy him, a clever rogue makes the long journey home from war. Braving the terrifying guardians of the underworld, a noble warrior ventures into the darkness to retrieve the soul of her lost love. Calling on their divine parentage, a group of demigods undertake twelve labors to win the gods’ blessings for othe<span class=\"No-Break\">r mortals.</span></p><p>A mythic-fantasy campaign draws on the themes and stories of ancient myth and legend, from Gilgamesh to Cú Chulainn. Adventurers attempt mighty feats of legend, aided or hindered by the gods or their agents — and they might have divine blood themselves. The monsters and villains they face probably have a similar origin. The minotaur in the dungeon isn’t just another bull-headed humanoid, but <span class=\"italic\">the</span> Minotaur — misbegotten offspring of a philandering god. Adventures might lead the heroes through a series of trials to the realms of the gods in search of a gift<span class=\"No-Break\"> or favor.</span></p><p>Such a campaign can draw on the myths and legends of any culture, not just the familiar Gr<span class=\"No-Break\">eek tales.</span></p><h3>Dark Fantasy</h3><p>Vampires brood on the battlements of their accursed castles. Necromancers toil in dark dungeons to create horrid servants made of dead flesh. Devils corrupt the innocent, and werewolves prowl the night. All of these elements evoke horrific aspects of the fant<span class=\"No-Break\">asy genre.</span></p><p>If you want to put a horror spin on your campaign, you have plenty of material to work with. The <span class=\"italic\"><em>Monster Manual</em></span> is full of creatures that perfectly suit a storyline of supernatural horror. The most important element of such a campaign, though, isn’t covered by the rules. A dark-fantasy setting requires an atmosphere of building dread, created through careful pacing and evocative description. Your players contribute too; they have to be willing to embrace the mood you’re trying to evoke. Whether you want to run a full-fledged dark-fantasy campaign or a single creepy adventure, you should discuss your plans with the players ahead of time to make sure they’re on board. Horror can be intense and personal, and not everyone is comfortable with su<span class=\"No-Break\">ch a game.</span></p><p>Novels and game products set in Ravenloft, the Demiplane of Dread, explore dark-fantasy elements in a D&amp;<span class=\"No-Break\">D context.</span></p><h3>Intrigue</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/813/c1-12.png\"></p><p>The corrupt vizier schemes with the baron’s oldest daughter to assassinate the baron. A hobgoblin army sends doppelganger spies to infiltrate the city before the invasion. At the embassy ball, the spy in the royal court makes contact with his<span class=\"No-Break\"> employer.</span></p><p>Political intrigue, espionage, sabotage, and similar cloak-and-dagger activities can provide the basis for an exciting D&amp;D campaign. In this kind of game, the characters might care more about skill training and making contacts than about attack spells and magic weapons. Roleplaying and social interaction take on greater importance than combat, and the party might go for several sessions without seeing <span class=\"No-Break\">a monster.</span></p><p>Again, make sure your players know ahead of time that you want to run this kind of campaign. Otherwise, a player might create a defense-focused dwarf paladin, only to find he is out of place among half-elf diplomats and tiefl<span class=\"No-Break\">ing spies.</span></p><p>The Brimstone Angels novels by Erin M. Evans focus on intrigue in the Forgotten Realms setting, from the backstabbing politics of the Nine Hells to the contested succession of Cormyrea<span class=\"No-Break\">n royalty.</span></p><h3>Mystery</h3><p>Who stole three legendary magic weapons and hid them away in a remote dungeon, leaving a cryptic clue to their location? Who placed the duke into a magical slumber, and what can be done to awaken him? Who murdered the guildmaster, and how did the killer get into the guild’s loc<span class=\"No-Break\">ked vault?</span></p><p>A mystery-themed campaign puts the characters in the role of investigators, perhaps traveling from town to town to crack tough cases the local authorities can’t handle. Such a campaign emphasizes puzzles and problem-solving in addition to comba<span class=\"No-Break\">t prowess.</span></p><p>A larger mystery might even set the stage for the whole campaign. Why did someone kill the characters’ mentor, setting them on the path of adventure? Who really controls the Cult of the Red Hand? In this case, the characters might uncover clues to the greater mystery only once in a while; individual adventures might be at best tangentially related to that theme. A diet of nothing but puzzles can become frustrating, so be sure to mix up the kinds of encounters yo<span class=\"No-Break\">u present.</span></p><p>Novels in various D&amp;D settings have explored the mystery genre with a fantasy twist. In particular, <span class=\"italic\">Murder in Cormyr</span> (by Chet Williamson), <span class=\"italic\">Murder in Halruaa</span> (by Richard S. Meyers), and <span class=\"italic\">Spellstorm</span> (by Ed Greenwood) are mysteries set in the Forgotten Realms. <span class=\"italic\">Murder in Tarsis</span> (by John Maddox Roberts) takes the same approach in the Dragonlanc<span class=\"No-Break\">e setting.</span></p><h3>Swashbuckling</h3><p>Rapier-wielding sailors fight off boarding sahuagin. Ghouls lurk in derelict ships, waiting to devour treasure hunters. Dashing rogues and charming paladins weave their way through palace intrigues and leap from balconies onto waiting hor<span class=\"No-Break\">ses below.</span></p><p>The swashbuckling adventures of pirates and musketeers suggest opportunities for a dynamic campaign. The characters typically spend more time in cities, royal courts, and seafaring vessels than in dungeon delves, making interaction skills important (though not to the extent of a pure intrigue campaign). Nevertheless, the heroes might end up in classic dungeon situations, such as searching storm sewers beneath the palace to find the evil duke’s hidden<span class=\"No-Break\"> chambers.</span></p><p>A good example of a swashbuckling rogue in the Forgotten Realms is Jack Ravenwild, who appears in novels by Richard Baker (<span class=\"italic\">City of Ravens</span> and <span class=\"italic\">Prince o</span><span class=\"No-Break\"><span class=\"italic\">f Ravens</span></span><span class=\"No-Break\">).</span></p><h3>War</h3><p>A hobgoblin army marches toward the city, leading elephants and giants to batter down the stronghold’s walls and ramparts. Dragons wheel above a barbarian horde, scattering enemies as the raging warriors cut a swath through field and forest. Salamanders muster at an efreeti’s command, poised to assault an astral<span class=\"No-Break\"> fortress.</span></p><p>Warfare in a fantasy world is rife with opportunities for adventure. A war campaign isn’t generally concerned with the specifics of troop movements, but instead focuses on the heroes whose actions turn the tide of battle. The characters carry out specific missions: capture a magical standard that empowers undead armies, gather reinforcements to break a siege, or cut through the enemy’s flank to reach a demonic commander. In other situations, the party supports the larger army by holding a strategic location until reinforcements arrive, killing enemy scouts before they can report, or cutting off supply lines. Information gathering and diplomatic missions can supplement the more combat-oriented a<span class=\"No-Break\">dventures.</span></p><p>The War of the Lance in the Dragonlance Chronicles novels and the War of the Spider Queen in the novel series of the same name are prominent examples of wars in D<span class=\"No-Break\">&amp;D novels.</span></p><h3>Wuxia</h3><p>When a sensei disappears mysteriously, her young students must take her place and hunt down the oni terrorizing their village. Accomplished heroes, masters of their respective martial arts, return home to free their village from an evil hobgoblin warlord. The rakshasa master of a nearby monastery performs rituals to raise troubled ghosts from t<span class=\"No-Break\">heir rest.</span></p><p>A campaign that draws on elements of Asian martial-arts movies is a perfect match for D&amp;D. Players can define the appearance of their characters and gear however they like for the campaign, and spells need only minor flavor changes so that they better reflect such a setting. For example, when the characters use spells or special abilities that teleport them short distances, they actually make high-flying acrobatic leaps. Ability checks to climb don’t involve careful searching for holds but let characters bounce up walls or from tree to tree. Warriors stun their opponents by striking pressure points. Flavorful descriptions of actions in the game don’t change the nuts and bolts of the rules, but they make all the difference in the feel of a<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><p>Similarly, a class doesn’t need new rules to reflect a cultural influence; a new name can do the trick. A traditional Chinese wuxia hero might be a paladin who has a sword called the Oath of Vengeance, while a Japanese samurai might be a paladin with a particular Oath of Devotion (<span class=\"italic\">bushido</span>) that includes fealty to a lord (<span class=\"italic\">daimyo</span>) among its tenets. A ninja is a monk who pursues the Way of Shadow. Whether called a wu jen, a tsukai, or a swami, a wizard, sorcerer, or warlock character works just fine in a game inspired by medieval Asian<span class=\"No-Break\"> cultures.</span></p><h4>Wuxia Weapon Names</h4><p>Having players refer to a <span class=\"italic\">tetsubo</span> or a <span class=\"italic\">katana</span> rather than a greatclub or a longsword can enhance the flavor of a wuxia campaign. The Wuxia Weapon Names table lists alternative names for common weapons from the <span class=\"italic\"><em>Player’s Handbook</em></span> and identifies their real-world cultural origins. An alternative name changes none of the weapon’s properties as they are described in the <span class=\"italic\">Player’s</span><span class=\"No-Break\"><span class=\"italic\"> Handbook</span></span><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table-header\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p><strong>Weapon</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p><strong>Other Names (Culture)</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-6\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Battleaxe</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p><span class=\"italic\">fu</span> (China);

Somewhere in the Barrier Peaks of Oerth, the wreckage of a spacefaring vessel is said to lie, with bizarre alien lifeforms and strange items of technology on board.

The plane of Elysium, for example, isn’t merely a place where good creatures dwell, and not even simply the place where spirits of good creatures go when they die. It is the plane of goodness, a spiritual realm where evil can’t flourish. It is as much a state of being and of mind as it is a physical<span class=\"No-Break\"> location.</span></p><p>The Inner Planes exemplify the physical essence and elemental nature of air, earth, fire, and water. The Elemental Plane of Fire, for example, embodies the essence of fire. The plane’s entire substance is suffused with the fundamental nature of fire: energy, passion, transformation, and destruction. Even objects of solid brass or basalt seem to dance with flame, in a visible and palpable manifestation of the vibrancy of fire’s<span class=\"No-Break\"> dominion.</span></p><p>In this context, the Material Plane is the nexus where all these philosophical and elemental forces collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and matter. The worlds of D&amp;D exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Mater<span class=\"No-Break\">ial Plane.</span></p><h3>Planar Categories</h3><p>The planes of the default D&amp;D cosmology are grouped in the following c<span class=\"No-Break\">ategories:</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">The </span><span class=\"bold\">Material Plane and Its Echoes.</span></strong> The Feywild and the Shadowfell are reflections of the Mater<span class=\"No-Break\">ial Plane.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">The </span><span class=\"bold\">Transitive Planes.</span></strong> The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are mostly featureless planes that serve primarily as pathways to travel from one plane t<span class=\"No-Break\">o another.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">The Inner Planes.</span></strong> The four Elemental Planes (Air, Earth, Fire, and Water), plus the Elemental Chaos that surrounds them, are the Inn<span class=\"No-Break\">er Planes.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">The Outer Planes.</span></strong> Sixteen Outer Planes correspond to the eight non-neutral alignments and shades of philosophical difference bet<span class=\"No-Break\">ween them.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">The Positive and Negative Planes.</span></strong> These two planes enfold the rest of the cosmology, providing the raw forces of life and death that underlie the rest of existence in the m<span class=\"No-Break\">ultiverse.</span></p><h3>Putting the Planes Together</h3><p>As described in the <span class=\"italic\"><em><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/appendix-c-the-planes-of-existence\">Player’s Handbook</a></em></span>, the assumed D&amp;D cosmology includes more than two dozen planes. For your campaign, you decide what planes to include, inspired by the standard planes, drawn from Earth’s myths, or created by your own im<span class=\"No-Break\">agination.</span></p><p>At minimum, most D&amp;D campaigns require these<span class=\"No-Break\"> elements:</span></p><ul>\n<li>A plane of origin <span class=\"No-Break\">for fiends</span></li>\n<li>A plane of origin for <span class=\"No-Break\">celestials</span></li>\n<li>A plane of origin for <span class=\"No-Break\">elementals</span></li>\n<li>A place for deities, which might include any or all of the prev<span class=\"No-Break\">ious three</span></li>\n<li>The place where mortal spirits go after death, which might include any or all of the f<span class=\"No-Break\">irst three</span></li>\n<li>A way of getting from one plane <span class=\"No-Break\">to another</span></li>\n<li>A way for spells and monsters that use the Astral Plane and the Ethereal Plane t<span class=\"No-Break\">o function</span></li>\n</ul><p>Once you’ve decided on the planes you want to use in your campaign, putting them into a coherent cosmology is an optional step. Since the primary way of traveling from plane to plane, even using the Transitive Planes, is through magical portals that link planes together, the exact relationship of different planes to one another is largely a theoretical concern. No being in the multiverse can look down and see the planes in their arrangement the same way as we look at a diagram in a book. No mortal can verify whether Mount Celestia is sandwiched between Bytopia and Arcadia, but it’s a convenient theoretical construct based on the philosophical shading among the three planes and the relative importance they give to law<span class=\"No-Break\"> and good.</span></p><p>Sages have constructed a few such theoretical models to make sense of the jumble of planes, particularly the Outer Planes. The three most common are the Great Wheel, the World Tree, and the World Axis, but you can create or adapt whatever model works best for the planes you want to use in <span class=\"No-Break\">your game.</span></p><h4>The Great Wheel</h4><p>The default cosmological arrangement presented in the <span class=\"italic\"><em><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/appendix-c-the-planes-of-existence\">Player’s Handbook</a></em></span> visualizes the planes as a group of concentric wheels, with the Material Plane and its echoes at the center. The Inner Planes form a wheel around the Material Plane, enveloped in the Ethereal Plane. Then the Outer Planes form another wheel around and behind (or above or below) that one, arranged according to alignment, with the Outlands linking<span class=\"No-Break\"> them all.</span></p><p>This arrangement makes sense of the way the River Styx flows among the Lower Planes, connecting Acheron, the Nine Hells, Gehenna, Hades, Carceri, the Abyss, and Pandemonium like beads on a string. But it’s not the only possible explanation of the river<span class=\"No-Break\">’s course.</span></p><h4>The World Tree</h4><p>A different arrangement of planes envisions them situated among the roots and branches of a great cosmic tree, literally or fig<span class=\"No-Break\">uratively.</span></p><p>For example, the Norse cosmology centers on the World Tree Yggdrasil. The three roots of the World Tree touch the three realms: Asgard (an Outer Plane that includes Valhalla, Vanaheim, Alfheim, and other regions), Midgard (the Material Plane), and Niflheim (the underworld). The Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, is a unique transitive plane that connects Asgard an<span class=\"No-Break\">d Midgard.</span></p><p>Similarly, one vision of the planes where the deities of the Forgotten Realms reside situates a number of celestial planes in the branches of a World Tree, while the fiendish planes are linked by a River of Blood. Neutral planes stand apart from them. Each of these planes is primarily the domain of one or more deities, though they are also the homes of celestial and fiendish <span class=\"No-Break\">creatures.</span></p><h4>The World Axis</h4><p>In this view of the cosmos, the Material Plane and its echoes stand between two opposing realms. The Astral Plane (or Astral Sea) floats above them, holding any number of divine domains (the Outer Planes). Below the Material Plane is the Elemental Chaos, a single, undifferentiated elemental plane where all the elements clash together. At the bottom of the Elemental Chaos is the Abyss, like a hole torn in the fabric of t<span class=\"No-Break\">he cosmos.</span></p><h4>Other Visions</h4><p>As you build your own cosmology, consider the following alt<span class=\"No-Break\">ernatives.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The Omniverse.</span></strong> This simple cosmology covers the bare minimum: a Material Plane; the Transitive Planes; a single Elemental Chaos; an Overheaven, where good-aligned deities and celestials live; and the Underworld, where evil deities and fi<span class=\"No-Break\">ends live.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"> Myriad Planes.</span></strong> In this cosmology, countless planes clump together like soap bubbles, intersecting with each other more or less <span class=\"No-Break\">at random.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The Orrery.</span></strong> All the Inner and Outer Planes orbit the Material Plane, exerting greater or lesser influence on the world as they come nearer and farther. The world of Eberron uses this cosmologi<span class=\"No-Break\">cal model.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"> The Winding Road.</span></strong> In this cosmology, every plane is a stop along an infinite road. Each plane is adjacent to two others, but there’s no necessary cohesion between adjacent planes; a traveler can walk from the slopes of Mount Celestia onto the slopes o<span class=\"No-Break\">f Gehenna.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"> Mount Olympus.</span></strong> In the Greek cosmology, Mount Olympus stands at the center of the world (the Material Plane), with its peak so high that it’s actually another plane of existence: Olympus, the home of the gods. All the Greek gods except Hades have their own domains within Olympus. In Hades, named for its ruler, mortal souls linger as insubstantial shades until they eventually fade into nothing. Tartarus, where the titans are imprisoned in endless darkness, lies below Hades. And far to the west of the known world in the Material Plane are the blessed Elysian Fields. The souls of great heroes res<span class=\"No-Break\">ide there.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"> Solar Barge.</span></strong> The Egyptian cosmology is defined by the daily path of the sun — across the sky of the Material Plane, down to the fair Offering Fields in the west, where the souls of the righteous live in eternal reward, and then beneath the world through the nightmarish Twelve Hours of Night. The Solar Barge is a tiny Outer Plane in its own right, though it exists within the Astral Plane and the other Outer Planes in the different stages of it<span class=\"No-Break\">s journey.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"> One World.</span></strong> In this model, there are no other planes of existence, but the Material Plane includes places like the bottomless Abyss, the shining Mount Celestia, the strange city of Mechanus, the fortress of Acheron, and so on. All the planes are locations in the world, reachable by ordinary means of travel — though extraordinary effort is required, for example, to sail across the sea to the blessed isles o<span class=\"No-Break\">f Elysium.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"> The Otherworld.</span></strong> In this model, the Material Plane has a twin realm that fills the role of all the other planes. Much like the Feywild, it overlays the Material Plane and can be reached through “thin places” where the worlds are particularly close: through caves, by sailing far across the sea, or in fairy rings in remote forests. It has dark, evil regions (homes of fiends and evil gods), sacred isles (homes of celestials and the spirits of the blessed death), and realms of elemental fury. This otherworld is sometimes overseen by an eternal city, or by four cities that each represent a different aspect of reality. The Celtic cosmology has an otherworld, called Tír na nÓg, and the cosmologies of some religions inspired by Asian myth have a similar Spi<span class=\"No-Break\">rit World.</span></p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>INVENTING YOUR OWN PLANES</strong></p>\n<p>Each of the planes described in this chapter has at least one significant effect on travelers who venture there. When you design your own planes, it’s a good idea to stick to that model. Create one simple trait that players notice, that doesn’t create too much complication at the gaming table, and that’s easy to remember. Try to reflect the philosophy and mood of the place, not merely its physical characteristics.</p>\n</blockquote><h2>Planar Travel</h2><p>When adventurers travel to other planes of existence, they undertake a legendary journey that might force them to face supernatural guardians and undergo various ordeals. The nature of that journey and the trials along the way depend in part on the means of travel, and whether the adventurers find a magic portal or use a spell to c<span class=\"No-Break\">arry them.</span></p><h3>Planar Portals</h3><blockquote>\n<p>[Raistlin’s] eyes studied the Portal, studied every detail intently — although it was not really necessary. He had seen it myriad times in dreams both sleeping and waking. The spells to open it were simple, nothing elaborate or complex. Each of the five dragon heads surrounding and guarding the Portal must be propitiated with the correct phrase. Each must be spoken to in the proper order. But, once that was done and the White-Robed Cleric had exhorted Paladine to intercede and hold the Portal open, they would enter. It would close be<span class=\"No-Break\">hind them.</span></p>\n<p>And he would face his greatest <span class=\"No-Break\">challenge.</span></p>\n<p>— Margaret Weis &amp; Tracy Hickman, <em>War of<span class=\"No-Break\"> the Twins</span></em></p>\n</blockquote><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/814/c2-02.png\"></p><p>“Portal” is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals function like doorways, appearing as a clear window or a fog-shrouded passage, and interplanar travel is as simple as stepping through the doorway. Other portals are locations — circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns — that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another. Some are vortices, joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane <span class=\"No-Break\">of Water).</span></p><p>Passing through a planar portal can be the simplest way to travel from the Material Plane to a desired location on another plane. Most of the time, though, a portal presents an adventure <span class=\"No-Break\">in itself.</span></p><p>First, the adventurers must find a portal that leads where they want to go. Most portals exist in distant locations, and a portal’s location often has thematic similarities to the plane it leads to. For example, a portal to the heavenly mountain of Celestia might be located on a moun<span class=\"No-Break\">tain peak.</span></p><p>Second, portals often have guardians charged with ensuring that undesirable people don’t pass through. Depending on the portal’s destination, “undesirable people” might include evil characters, good characters, cowards, thieves, anyone wearing a robe, or any mortal creature. A portal’s guardian is typically a powerful magical creature, such as a genie, sphinx, titan, or native of the portal’s destinat<span class=\"No-Break\">ion plane.</span></p><p>Finally, most portals don’t stand open all the time, but open only in particular situations or when a certain requirement is met. A portal can have any conceivable requirement, but the following are the mo<span class=\"No-Break\">st common:</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Time.</span></strong> The portal functions only at particular times: during a full moon on the Material Plane, or every ten days, or when the stars are in a particular position. Once it opens, such a portal remains open for a limited time, such as for three days following the full moon, or for an hour, or for 1d4 +<span class=\"No-Break\"> 1 rounds.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Situation.</span></strong> The portal functions only if a particular condition is met. A situation-keyed portal opens on a clear night, or when it rains, or when a certain spell is cast in its<span class=\"No-Break\"> vicinity.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Random.</span></strong> A random portal functions for a random period, then shuts down for a similarly random duration. Typically, such a portal allows 1d6 + 6 travelers to pass through, then shuts down for<span class=\"No-Break\"> 1d6 days.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Command Word.</span></strong> The portal functions only if a particular command word is spoken. Sometimes the word must be spoken as a character passes through the portal (which is otherwise a mundane doorway, window, or similar opening). Other portals open when the command word is spoken and remain open for a s<span class=\"No-Break\">hort time.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Key.</span></strong> The portal functions if the traveler is holding a particular object; the item acts much like a key to a door. This key item can be a common object or a particular key created for that portal. The city of Sigil above the Outlands is known as the City of Doors because it features an overwhelming number of such item-keye<span class=\"No-Break\">d portals.</span></p><p>Learning and meeting a portal’s requirements can draw characters into further adventures as they chase down a key item, scour old libraries for command words, or consult sages to find the right time to visit t<span class=\"No-Break\">he portal.</span></p><h3>Spells</h3><blockquote>\n<p>Sarya raised her hands and began to declaim the words of a very powerful spell, one of the most dangerous she knew, a spell designed to breach the barriers between the planes and create a magical bridge into another realm of existence. The mythal thrummed in response, the intangible pulse of the old device taking on a new and different note. Sarya ignored the mythal stone’s change and pressed on, finishing her gate spell with skill and confidence.</p>\n<p>“The gate is open!” she cried. “Malkizid, co<span class=\"No-Break\">me forth!”</span></p>\n<p>Before Sarya a great ring or hoop of golden magic coalesced from the air. Through it she glimpsed the realm of Malkizid, an infernal wasteland of parched desert, windswept rifts, and black, angry skies torn by crimson lightning. Then, through the gate, the archdevil Malkizid appeared. With one smooth step he crossed from his infernal plane into the mythal chamber.</p>\n<p>— Richard Baker, <em>Fart<span class=\"No-Break\">hest Reach</span></em></p>\n</blockquote><p>A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence. <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"Plane shift\">Plane shift</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gate\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"gate\">gate</a> can directly transport adventurers to any other plane, with different degrees of precision. <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/etherealness\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"Etherealness\">Etherealness</a> allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane. And the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/astral-projection\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"astral projection\">astral projection</a> spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and from there travel to the Outer Planes.</p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"Plane Shift\">Plane Shift</a>.</span></strong> The <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"plane shift\">plane shift</a> spell has two important limitations. The first is the material component: a small, forked, metal rod (like a tuning fork) attuned to the desired planar destination. The spell requires the proper resonating frequency to home in on the correct location, and the fork must be made of the right material (sometimes a complex alloy) to focus the spell’s magic properly. Crafting the fork is expensive (at least 250 gp), but even the act of researching the correct specifications can lead to adventure. After all, not many people voluntarily travel into the depths of Carceri, so very few know what kind of tuning fork is required to <span class=\"No-Break\">get there.</span></p><p>Second, the spell doesn’t send the caster to a specific location unless he or she has specialized information. The sigil sequence of a teleportation circle located on another plane allows the caster to travel directly to that circle, but such knowledge is even harder to come by than the specifications of the required tuning fork. Otherwise, the spell transports the caster to a location in the general vicinity of the desired spot. Wherever the adventurers arrive, they’ll most likely still need to undertake a journey to reach the object of a pla<span class=\"No-Break\">nar quest.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gate\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"Gate\">Gate</a>. </span></strong>The <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gate\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"gate\">gate</a> spell opens a portal linked to a specific point on another plane of existence. The spell provides a shortcut to a planar destination, bypassing many of the guardians and trials that would normally fill such a journey. But this 9th-level spell is out of reach for all but the most powerful characters, and it does nothing to negate any obstacles that wait at the destination.</p><p>The <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gate\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"gate\">gate</a></span> spell is powerful, but not infallible. A deity, demon lord, or other powerful entity can prevent such a portal from opening within its dominion.</p><h2>Astral Plane</h2><p><img class=\"compendium-header-banner-img\" src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/815/c2-03.png\" alt=\"\"></p><blockquote>\n<p>Halisstra opened her eyes and found herself drifting in an endless silver sea. Soft gray clouds moved slowly in the distance, while strange dark streaks twisted violently through the sky, anchored in ends so distant she couldn’t perceive them, their middle parts revolving angrily like pieces of string rolled between a child’s fingertips. She glanced down, wondering what supported her, and saw nothing but more of the strange pearly sky beneath her feet and all a<span class=\"No-Break\">round her.</span></p>\n<p>She drew in a sudden breath, surprised by the sight, and felt her lungs fill with something sweeter and perhaps a little more solid than air, but instead of gagging or drowning on the stuff she seemed perfectly acclimated to it. An electric thrill raced through her limbs as she found herself mesmerized by the simple act of re<span class=\"No-Break\">spiration.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Epigraph-Author\"> — Richard Baker,</span> <em>Co<span class=\"No-Break\">ndemnation</span></em></p>\n</blockquote><p>The Astral Plane is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the Outer Planes. It is a great silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light like distant stars. Most of the Astral Sea is a vast, empty expanse. Visitors occasionally stumble upon the petrified corpse of a dead god or other chunks of rock drifting forever in the silvery void. Much more commonplace are color pools — magical pools of colored light that flicker like radiant, spinn<span class=\"No-Break\">ing coins.</span></p><p>Creatures on the Astral Plane don’t age or suffer from hunger or thirst. For this reason, humanoids that live on the Astral Plane (such as the githyanki) establish outposts on other planes, often the Material Plane, so their children can grow to<span class=\"No-Break\"> maturity.</span></p><p>A traveler in the Astral Plane can move by simply thinking about moving, but distance has little meaning. In combat, though, a creature’s walking speed (in feet) is equal to 3 × its Intelligence score. The smarter a creature is, the easier it can control its movement by act of will.</p><h3>Astral Projection</h3><p>Traveling through the Astral Plane by means of the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/astral-projection\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"astral projection\">astral projection</a> spell involves projecting one’s consciousness there, usually in search of a gateway to an Outer Plane to visit. Since the Outer Planes are as much spiritual states of being as they are physical places, this allows a character to manifest in an Outer Plane as if he or she had physically traveled there, but as in a dream. A character’s death — either in the Astral Plane or on the destination plane — causes no actual harm. Only the severing of a character’s silver cord while on the Astral Plane (or the death of his or her helpless physical body on the Material Plane) can result in the character’s true death. Thus, high-level characters sometimes travel to the Outer Planes by way of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/astral-projection\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"astral projection\">astral projection</a> rather than seek out a portal or use a more dir<span class=\"No-Break\">ect spell.</span></p><p>Only a few things can sever a traveler’s silver cord, the most common being a psychic wind (described below). The legendary silver swords of the githyanki also have this ability. A character who travels bodily to the Astral Plane (by means of the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"plane shift\">plane shift</a> spell or one of the rare portals that leads directly there) has no si<span class=\"No-Break\">lver cord.</span></p><h3>Color Pools</h3><p>Gateways leading from the Astral Plane to other planes appear as two-dimensional pools of rippling colors, 1d6 × 10 feet in diameter. Traveling to another plane requires locating a color pool that leads to the desired plane. These gateways to other planes can be identified by color, as shown on the Astral Color Pools table. Finding the right color pool is a matter of chance: locating the correct one takes 1d4 × 10 hours <span class=\"No-Break\">of travel.</span></p><h4>Astral Color Pools</h4><div><table

Wind</h3><p>A psychic wind isn’t a physical wind like that found on the Material Plane, but a storm of thought that batters travelers’ minds rather than their bodies. A psychic wind is made up of lost memories, forgotten ideas, minor musings, and subconscious fears that went astray in the Astral Plane and conglomerated into this power<span class=\"No-Break\">ful force.</span></p><p>A psychic wind is first sensed as a rapid darkening of the silver-gray sky. After a few rounds, the area becomes as dark as a moonless night. As the sky darkens, the traveler feels buffeting and shaking, as if the plane itself was rebelling against the storm. As quickly as it comes, the psychic wind passes, and the sky returns to normal in a f<span class=\"No-Break\">ew rounds.</span></p><p>The psychic wind has two kinds of effects: a location effect and a mental effect. A group of travelers journeying together suffers the same location effect. Each traveler affected by the wind must also make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the traveler suffers the mental effect as well.

The most prominent denizens of the Astral Plane are the githyanki, an outcast race of reavers that sail sleek astral ships, slaughter astral travelers, and raid planes touched by the Astral. Their city, Tu’narath, floats through the Astral Plane on a chunk of rock that is actually the body of a<span class=\"No-Break\"> dead god.</span></p><p>Celestials, fiends, and mortal explorers often scour the Astral Plane for color pools leading to desired destinations. Characters who linger for too long in the Astral might have an encounter with one or more wandering angels, demons, devils, night hags, yugoloths, or other planar <span class=\"No-Break\">travelers.</span></p><h2>Ethereal Plane</h2><blockquote>\n<p>Tamlin felt a hand on him, felt his body shimmer into mist. The screams and shouts sounded far off. The walls around him appeared to be only gray shadows.

Its “shores,” called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Visibility in the Border Ethereal is limited to 60 feet. The plane’s depths comprise a region of swirling mist and fog called the Deep Ethereal, where visibility is limited t<span class=\"No-Break\">o 30 feet.</span></p><p>Characters can use the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/etherealness\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"etherealness\">etherealness</a></span> spell to enter the Border Ethereal. The <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"plane shift\">plane shift</a> spell allows transport to the Border Ethereal or the Deep Ethereal, but unless the intended destination is a specific location or a teleportation circle, the point of arrival could be anywhere on <span class=\"No-Break\">the plane.</span></p><h3>Border Ethereal</h3><p>From the Border Ethereal, a traveler can see into whatever plane it overlaps, but that plane appears muted and indistinct, its colors blurring into each other and its edges turning fuzzy. Ethereal denizens watch the plane as though peering through distorted and frosted glass, and can’t see anything beyond 30 feet into the other plane. Conversely, the Ethereal Plane is usually invisible to those on the overlapped planes, except with the aid<span class=\"No-Break\"> of magic.</span></p><p>Normally, creatures in the Border Ethereal can’t attack creatures on the overlapped plane, and vice versa. A traveler on the Ethereal Plane is invisible and utterly silent to someone on the overlapped plane, and solid objects on the overlapped plane don’t hamper the movement of a creature in the Border Ethereal. The exceptions are certain magical effects (including anything made of magical force) and living beings. This makes the Ethereal Plane ideal for reconnaissance, spying on opponents, and moving around without being detected. The Ethereal Plane also disobeys the laws of gravity; a creature there can move up and down as easily a<span class=\"No-Break\">s walking.</span></p><h3>Deep Ethereal</h3><p>To reach the Deep Ethereal, one needs a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"plane shift\">plane shift</a> spell or arrive by means of a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gate\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"gate\">gate</a></span> spell or magical portal. Visitors to the Deep Ethereal are engulfed by roiling mist. Scattered throughout the plane are curtains of vaporous color, and passing through a curtain leads a traveler to a region of the Border Ethereal connected to a specific Inner Plane, the Material Plane, the Feywild, or the Shadowfell. The color of the curtain indicates the plane whose Border Ethereal the curtain conceals; see the Ethereal Curta<span class=\"No-Break\">ins table.</span></p><h4>Ethereal Curtains</h4><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<th>d8</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Plane</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Color of Curtain</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">1</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Material Plane</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Bright turquoise</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-6\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">2</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Shadowfell</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Dusky gray</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">3</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Feywild</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Opalescent white</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-6\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">4</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Plane of Air</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Pale blue</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">5</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Plane of Earth</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Reddish-brown</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-6\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">6</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Plane of Fire</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Orange</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">7</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Plane of Water</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Green</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-6\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">8</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Elemental Chaos</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Swirling mix of colors</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p>Traveling through the Deep Ethereal to journey from one plane to another is unlike physical travel. Distance is meaningless, so although travelers feel as if they can move by a simple act of will, it’s impossible to measure speed and hard to track the passage of time. A trip between planes through the Deep Ethereal takes 1d10 × 10 hours, regardless of the origin and destination. In combat, however, creatures are considered to move at their norm<span class=\"No-Break\">al speeds.</span></p><h3>Ether Cyclones</h3><p>An ether cyclone is a serpentine column that spins through the plane. The cyclone appears abruptly, distorting and uprooting ethereal forms in its path and carrying the debris for leagues. Travelers with a passive Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) score of 15 or more receive 1d4 rounds of warning: a deep hum in the ethereal matter. Travelers who can’t reach a curtain or portal leading elsewhere suffer the cyclone’s effect. Roll a d20 and consult the Ether Cyclone table to determine the effect on all creatures in the<span class=\"No-Break\"> vicinity.</span></p><h4>Ether Cyclone</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1871261142\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[IaRyaQOP3qtwSQHM]{Effect}</span></div></div></div><p>The most common effect of an ether cyclone is to extend the duration of a journey. Each character in a group traveling together must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If at least half the group succeeds, travel is delayed by 1d10 hours. Otherwise, the journey’s travel time is doubled. Less often, a group is blown into the Border Ethereal of a random plane. Rarely, the cyclone tears a hole in the fabric of the plane and hurls the party into the Ast<span class=\"No-Break\">ral Plane.</span></p><h3>Ethereal Plane Encounters</h3><p>Most encounters in the Border Ethereal are with creatures on the Material Plane whose senses or abilities extend into the Ethereal Plane (<span class=\"plural-monster-tooltip\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/phase-spider\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"phase spider\">phase spider</a><strong>s</strong></span>, for example). <span class=\"plural-monster-tooltip\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ghost\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"Ghost\">Ghost</a><strong>s</strong></span> also move freely between the Ethereal and Materi<span class=\"No-Break\">al Planes.</span></p><p>In the Deep Ethereal, most encounters are with other travelers, particularly ones from the Inner Planes (such as elementals, genies, and salamanders), as well as the occasional celestial, fien<span class=\"No-Break\">d, or fey.</span></p><h2>Feywild</h2><p><img class=\"compendium-header-banner-img\" src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/817/c2-05.png\" alt=\"\"></p><blockquote>\n<p>Stepping into the portal was like settling into a warm bath, though the chill didn’t fade from the air. At first everything muted — the roar of the river around the rocks below, the chirping of frogs and crickets on shore, the evening bustle of the town behind him. . . . A moment later, the world erupted into vibrant life. Frogs and night birds sang a chorus; the air was awash with autumn scents; the moonlight painted the flowers in iridescent blue, silver, and violet; and the rushing of the river became a complex<span class=\"No-Break\"> symphony.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Epigraph-Author\"> — James Wyatt,</span> <em>Oath of<span class=\"No-Break\"> Vigilance</span></em></p>\n</blockquote><p>The Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie, is a land of soft lights and wonder, a place of music and death. It is a realm of everlasting twilight, with glittering faerie lights bobbing in the gentle breeze and fat fireflies buzzing through groves and fields. The sky is alight with the faded colors of an ever-setting sun, which never truly sets (or rises for that matter); it remains stationary, dusky and low in the sky. Away from the settled areas ruled by the seelie fey that compose the Summer Court, the land is a tangle of sharp-toothed brambles and syrupy fens — perfect territory for the unseelie fey to hunt t<span class=\"No-Break\">heir prey.</span></p><p>The Feywild exists in parallel to the Material Plane, an alternate dimension that occupies the same cosmological space. The landscape of the Feywild mirrors the natural world but turns its features into spectacular forms. Where a volcano stands on the Material Plane, a mountain topped with skyscraper-sized crystals that glow with internal fire towers in the Feywild. A wide and muddy river on the Material Plane might be echoed as a clear and winding brook of great beauty. A marsh could be reflected as a vast black bog of sinister character. And moving to the Feywild from old ruins on the Material Plane might put a traveler at the door of an archfey<span class=\"No-Break\">’s castle.</span></p><p>The Feywild is inhabited by sylvan creatures, such as elves, dryads, satyrs, pixies, and sprites, as well as centaurs and magical creatures such as blink dogs, faerie dragons, treants, and unicorns. The darker regions of the plane are home to such malevolent creatures as hags, blights, goblins, ogres, a<span class=\"No-Break\">nd giants.</span></p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>SEELIE AND UNSEELIE FEY</strong></p>\n<p>Two queens hold court in the Feywild, and most fey owe allegiance to one or the other. Queen Titania and her Summer Court lead the seelie fey, and the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court, leads the uns<span class=\"No-Break\">eelie fey.</span></p>\n<p>Seelie and unseelie do not directly correlate with good and evil, though many mortals make that equation. Many seelie fey are good, and many unseelie are evil, but their opposition to each other stems from their queens’ jealous rivalry, not abstract moral concerns. Ugly denizens of the Feywild, such as fomorians and hags, are almost never members of either court, and fey of independent spirit reject the courts entirely. The courts have warred at times, but they also compete in more-or-less friendly contests and even ally with one another in small and se<span class=\"No-Break\">cret ways.</span></p>\n</blockquote><h3>Fey Crossings</h3><p>Fey crossings are places of mystery and beauty on the Material Plane that have a near-perfect mirror in the Feywild, creating a portal where the two planes touch. A traveler passes through a fey crossing by entering a clearing, wading into a pool, stepping into a circle of mushrooms, or crawling under the trunk of a tree. To the traveler, it seems like he or she has simply walked into the Feywild with a step. To an observer, the traveler is there one moment and gone<span class=\"No-Break\"> the next.</span></p><p>Like other portals between planes, most fey crossings open infrequently. A crossing might open only during a full moon, on the dawn of a particular day, or for someone carrying a certain type of item. A fey crossing can be closed permanently if the land on either side is dramatically altered — for example, if a castle is built over the clearing on the Mater<span class=\"No-Break\">ial Plane.</span></p><h3>Optional Rules: Feywild Magic</h3><p>Tales speak of children kidnapped by fey creatures and spirited away to the Feywild, only to return to their parents years later without having aged a day, and with no memories of their captors or the realm they came from. Likewise, adventurers who return from an excursion to the Feywild are often alarmed to discover upon their return that time flows differently on the Plane of Faerie, and that the memories of their visit are hazy. You can use these optional rules to reflect the strange magic that suffuses <span class=\"No-Break\">the plane.</span></p><h4>Memory Loss</h4><p>A creature that leaves the Feywild must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. Fey creatures automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do any creatures, like elves, that have the Fey Ancestry trait. A creature that fails the saving throw remembers nothing from its time spent in the Feywild. On a successful save, the creature’s memories remain intact but are a little hazy. Any spell that can end a curse can restore the creature’s lost<span class=\"No-Break\"> memories.</span></p><h4>Time Warp</h4><p>While time seems to pass normally in the Feywild, characters might spend a day there and realize, upon leaving the plane, that less or more time has elapsed everywhere else in the m<span class=\"No-Break\">ultiverse.</span></p><p>Whenever a creature or group of creatures leaves the Feywild after spending at least 1 day on that plane, you can choose a time change that works best for your campaign, if any, or roll on the Feywild Time Warp table. A <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wish\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"wish\">wish</a> spell can be used to remove the effect on up to ten creatures. Some powerful fey have the ability to grant such wishes and might do so if the beneficiaries agree to subject themselves to a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/geas\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"geas\">geas</a> spell and complete a quest after the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wish\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"wish\">wish</a> spell is cast.</p><h4>Feywild Time Warp</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"82747122\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[C4lKCV3zxFlkqbvt]{Result}</span></div></div></div><h2>Shadowfell</h2><blockquote>\n<p>Riven stood in the uppermost room of the central tower of his citadel — a fortress of shadows and dark stone carved in relief into the sheer face of a jagged peak. . . . The starless black vault of the plane’s sky hung over a landscape of gray and black, where lived the dark simulacra of actual things. Shadows and wraiths and specters and ghosts and other undead hung in the air around the citadel, or prowled the foothills and plains near it, so numerous their glowing eyes looked like swarms of fireflies. He felt the darkness in everything he could see, felt it as an extension of himself, and the feeling made him too bi<span class=\"No-Break\">g by half.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Epigraph-Author\"> — Paul S. Kemp,</span> <em>T<span class=\"No-Break\">he Godborn</span></em></p>\n</blockquote><p>The Shadowfell, also called the Plane of Shadow, is a dimension of black, gray, and white where most other color has been leached from everything. It is a place of darkness that hates the light, where the sky is a black vault with neither sun <span class=\"No-Break\">nor stars.</span></p><p>The Shadowfell overlaps the Material Plane in much the same way as the Feywild. Aside from the colorless landscape, it appears similar to the Material Plane. Landmarks from the Material Plane are recognizable on the Shadowfell, but they are twisted and warped — distorted reflections of what exists on the Material Plane. Where a mountain stands on the Material Plane, the corresponding feature on the Shadowfell is a jagged rock outcropping with a resemblance to a skull, a heap of rubble, or perhaps the crumbling ruin of a once-great castle. A forest on the Shadowfell is dark and twisted, its branches reaching out to snare travelers’ cloaks, and its roots coiling and buckling to trip those wh<span class=\"No-Break\">o pass by.</span></p><p>Shadow dragons and undead creatures haunt this bleak plane, as do other creatures that thrive in the gloom, including cloakers and da<span class=\"No-Break\">rkmantles.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/818/c2-06.png\"></p><h3>Shadow Crossings</h3><p>Similar to fey crossings, shadow crossings are locations where the veil between the Material Plane and the Shadowfell is so thin that creatures can walk from one plane to the other. A blot of shadow in the corner of a dusty crypt might be a shadow crossing, as might an open grave. Shadow crossings form in gloomy places where spirits or the stench of death lingers, such as battlefields, graveyards, and tombs. They manifest only in darkness, closing as soon as they feel lig<span class=\"No-Break\">ht’s kiss.</span></p><div>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>EVERNIGHT</strong></p>\n<p>The city of Neverwinter in the world of the Forgotten Realms has a dark reflection on the Shadowfell: the city of Evernight. Evernight is a city of cracked stone edifices and homes of rotten wood. Its roads are made mostly of trampled grave dust, and its few cobbled streets are missing enough stones that they appear pockmarked. The sky is corpse gray, and the breeze blows cold and humid, bringing a chill to<span class=\"No-Break\"> the skin.</span></p>\n<p>The city’s living residents include mad necromancers, corrupt purveyors of human flesh, worshipers of evil deities, and others who are able to make themselves useful and crazy enough to want to live here. But the living are a minority in Evernight, for the bulk of the population consists of the shambling dead. Zombies, wights, vampires, and other undead make the city their home, all under the watchful eyes of the ruling caste: intelligent, flesh-eati<span class=\"No-Break\">ng ghouls.</span></p>\n<p>Rumors abound that this foul place mirrors one city on ev<span class=\"No-Break\">ery world.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><h3>Domains of Dread</h3><p>In remote corners of the Shadowfell, it is easy to reach horrific demiplanes ruled over by accursed beings of terrible evil. The best known of these is the valley of Barovia, overlooked by the towering spires of Castle Ravenloft and ruled by Count Strahd von Zarovich, the first vampire. Beings of the Shadowfell called the Dark Powers created these domains as prisons for these “darklords,” and through cruelty or carelessness trapped innocent mortals in these domain<span class=\"No-Break\">s as well.</span></p><h3>Optional Rule: Shadowfell Despair</h3><p>A melancholic atmosphere pervades the Shadowfell. Extended forays to this plane can afflict characters with despair, as reflected in this opti<span class=\"No-Break\">onal rule.</span></p><p>When you deem it appropriate, though usually not more than once per day, you can require a character not native to the Shadowfell to make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the character is affected by despair. Roll a d6 to determine the effects, using the Shadowfell Despair table. You can substitute different despair effects of your own<span class=\"No-Break\"> creation.</span></p><h4>Shadowfell Despair</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-937456962\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[NlO43ng6bJ1gPEJ6]{Effect}</span></div></div></div><p>If a character is already suffering a despair effect and fails the saving throw, the new despair effect replaces the old one. After finishing a long rest, a character can attempt to overcome the despair with a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. (The DC is higher because it’s harder to shake off despair once it has taken hold.)

Around him, a sea of lava burped gouts of gas and jets of flame. The Elemental Plan<span class=\"No-Break\">e of Fire.</span></p>\n<p>Thank the fell ones, Vhok thought. I never thought I’d be so happy t<span class=\"No-Break\">o be here.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Epigraph-Author\"> — Thomas M. Reid,</span> <em>The Goss<span class=\"No-Break\">amer Plain</span></em></p>\n</blockquote><p>The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all worlds were made. The four Elemental Planes — Air, Earth, Fire, and Water — form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within a churning realm known as the Elemental Chaos. These planes are all connected, and the border regions between them are sometimes described as distinct planes in their <span class=\"No-Break\">own right.</span></p><p>At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble places in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. But the dominant element exerts a strong influence on the environment, reflecting its fundamental <span class=\"No-Break\">qualities.</span></p><p>The inhabitants of this inner ring include aarakocra, azers, dragon turtles, gargoyles, genies, mephits, salamanders, and xorn. Some originated on the Material Plane, and all can travel to the Material Plane (if they have access to the magic required) and surv<span class=\"No-Break\">ive there.</span></p><p>As they extend farther from the Material Plane, the Elemental Planes become increasingly alien and hostile. Here, in the outermost regions, the elements exist in their purest form: great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. Any foreign substance is extremely rare; little air can be found in the outermost reaches of the Plane of Earth, and earth is all but impossible to find in the outermost reaches of the Plane of Fire. These areas are much less hospitable to travelers from the Material Plane than the border regions are. Such regions are little known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means the bord<span class=\"No-Break\">er region.</span></p><p>The outermost regions are largely the domains of elemental spirits barely recognizable as creatures. The creatures usually called elementals dwell here, including the Elemental Princes of Evil (primordial beings of pure elemental fury) and elemental spirits that spellcasters can bind into galeb duhrs, golems, invisible stalkers, magmin, and water weirds. These elemental creatures don’t need food or other sustenance on their home planes, because they are sustained by the elemental energies that saturate tho<span class=\"No-Break\">se planes.</span></p><h3>Elemental Chaos</h3><p>At the farthest extents of the Elemental Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance called the Elemental Chaos. Elementals can be found here as well, but they usually don’t stay long, preferring the comfort of their native planes. Reports indicate the existence of weird hybrid elementals native to the Elemental Chaos, but such creatures are seldom seen on oth<span class=\"No-Break\">er planes.</span></p><h3>Plane of Air</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/819/c2-07.png\"></p><p>The essential nature of air is movement, animation, and inspiration. Air is the breath of life, the winds of change, the fresh breeze that clears away the fog of ignorance and the stuffiness of <span class=\"No-Break\">old ideas.</span></p><p>The Plane of Air is an open expanse with constant winds of varying strength. Here and there, chunks of earth drift in the openness — the remnants of failed invasions by denizens of the Plane of Earth. These earth motes serve as homes for the creatures of elemental air, and many motes are covered with lush vegetation. Other creatures live on cloud banks infused with enough magic to become solid surfaces, strong enough to support towns an<span class=\"No-Break\">d castles.</span></p><p>Drifting cloud banks can obscure visibility in any direction in the plane. Storms are frequent, mostly on par with a strong thunderstorm but occasionally more like fierce tornadoes or mighty hurricanes. The air is mild, except near the Plane of Water (where it is biting cold) and the Plane of Fire (where it is searing hot). Rain and snow fall only in the part of the plane nearest to the Plane<span class=\"No-Break\"> of Water.</span></p><p>Most of the Plane of Air is a complex web of air streams, currents, and winds called the <strong><span class=\"bold\">Labyrinth Winds</span></strong>. These range from stiff breezes to howling gales that can rip a creature apart. Even the most skilled flying creatures must navigate these currents carefully, flying with the winds, not aga<span class=\"No-Break\">inst them.</span></p><p>Here and there among the Labyrinth Winds are hidden realms reachable only by following a particular sequence of flowing winds, and thus largely protected against attackers. One such realm is fabled <strong><span class=\"bold\">Aaqa</span></strong>, a shining domain of silver spires and verdant gardens atop a fertile earth mote. The Wind Dukes of Aaqa are dedicated to law and good, and they maintain a vigilant watch against the depredations of elemental evil and the encroachment of the Elemental Chaos. They are served by aarakocra and a little-known race called <span class=\"No-Break\">the vaati.</span></p><p>The region of the Plane of Air nearest the Great Conflagration is called the <strong><span class=\"bold\">Sirocco Straits</span></strong>. Hot, dry winds scour the earth motes in this area to dry and barren chunks of rock. Gargoyles and their allies from the Plane of Earth gather here to launch raids into the real<span class=\"No-Break\">m of Aaqa.</span></p><p>Between the Sea of Fire (on the Plane of Fire) and the Sirocco Straits is a towering firestorm called the <strong><span class=\"bold\">Great Conflagration</span></strong>, sometimes called the Plane of Ash. Howling winds from the Plane of Air mix with the cinder storms and lava of the Plane of Fire to create an endless storm front — a wall of flames, smoke, and ash. The thick ash obscures sight beyond a few dozen feet, and the battering winds make travel difficult. Here and there, ash clusters into floating realms where outlaws and fugitives tak<span class=\"No-Break\">e shelter.</span></p><p>At the other end of the plane, near the Frostfell (the plane of ice that borders the Plane of Water), is a region of frigid winds called the <strong><span class=\"bold\">Mistral Reach</span></strong>. These gales drive snowstorms into the Frostfell and away from it, toward the heart of the plane. Earth motes in the reach are covered with sno<span class=\"No-Break\">w and ice.</span></p><h3>Plane of Earth</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/830/c2-08.png\"></p><p>Earth symbolizes stability, rigidity, stern resolve, and tradition. The plane’s position opposite the Plane of Air in the ring of the Elemental Planes reflects its opposition to almost everything air r<span class=\"No-Break\">epresents.</span></p><p>The Plane of Earth is a chain of mountains rising higher than any mountain range in the Material Plane. It has no sun of its own, and no air surrounds the peaks of its highest mountains. Most visitors to the plane arrive by way of caves and caverns that honeycomb the <span class=\"No-Break\">mountains.</span></p><p>The largest cavern beneath the mountains, called the Great Dismal Delve or the Sevenfold Mazework, is home to the capital city of the dao, the <strong><span class=\"bold\">City of Jewels</span></strong>. The dao take great pride in their wealth and send teams of slaves across the plane in search of new veins of ore and gemstones to exploit. Thanks to their efforts, every building and significant object in the city is made from precious stones and metals, including the slender gemstone-inlaid spires that top most buildings. The city is protected by a powerful spell that alerts the entire dao population if a visitor steals even a single stone. Theft is punishable by death, with punishment extending to the thief’s <span class=\"No-Break\">relatives.</span></p><p>The mountains nearest the Fountains of Creation (on the Plane of Fire) are called the <strong><span class=\"bold\">Furnaces</span></strong>. Lava seeps through their caverns, and the air reeks of sulfur. The dao have great forges and smelting furnaces here to process their ores and shape their precio<span class=\"No-Break\">us metals.</span></p><p>The border region between the planes of Water and Earth is a horrid swamp where twisted, gnarled trees and thick, stinging vines grow from the dense muck and slime. Here and there within the <strong><span class=\"bold\">Swamp of Oblivion</span></strong> (also called the Plane of Ooze), stagnant lakes and pools play host to thickets of weeds and monstrous swarms of mosquitoes. The few settlements here consist of wooden structures suspended above the muck. Most are built on platforms between trees, but a few stand on stilts driven deep into the muck. No solid earth underlies the mud of the swamp, so houses built on poles eventually sink dow<span class=\"No-Break\">n into it.</span></p><p>It is said that any object cast into the Swamp of Oblivion can’t be found again for at least a century. Now and then, a desperate soul casts an artifact of power into this place, removing it from the multiverse for a time. The promise of powerful magic lures adventurers to brave the monstrous insects and hags of the swamp in search of these <span class=\"No-Break\">treasures.</span></p><p>The region of the plane nearest the Swamp of Oblivion is called the <strong><span class=\"bold\">Mud Hills</span></strong>. Landslides constantly wear away the slopes of the hills, sending cascades of earth and stone into the bottomless swamp. The Plane of Earth seems to constantly regenerate the land, pushing new hills up as the old ones erode t<span class=\"No-Break\">o nothing.</span></p><h3>Plane of Fire</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/821/c2-09.png\"></p><p>Fire represents vibrancy, passion, and change. At its worst, it is cruel and wantonly destructive, as the efreet often are, but at its best, fire reflects the light of inspiration, the warmth of compassion, and the flame <span class=\"No-Break\">of desire.</span></p><p>A blazing sun hangs at the zenith of a golden sky above the Plane of Fire, waxing and waning on a 24-hour cycle. It ranges from white hot at noon to deep red at midnight, so the darkest hours of the plane display a deep red twilight. At noon, the light is nearly blinding. Most business in the City of Brass (see below) takes place during the dar<span class=\"No-Break\">ker hours.</span></p><p>The weather on the plane is marked by fierce winds and thick ash. Although the air is breathable, creatures not native to the plane must cover their mouths and eyes to avoid stinging cinders. The efreet use magic to keep the cinder storms away from the City of Brass, but elsewhere in the plane, the wind is always at least blustery and rises to hurricane force during the wor<span class=\"No-Break\">st storms.</span></p><p>The heat in the Plane of Fire is comparable to a hot desert on the Material Plane, and poses a similar threat to travelers (see “Extreme Heat” in chapter 5, “<a title=\"Extreme Heat\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/adventure-environments#ExtremeHeat\">Adventure Environments</a>”). The deeper one goes into the plane, the rarer water becomes. Beyond a point, the plane holds no sources of water, so travelers must carry their own supplies or produce water<span class=\"No-Break\"> by magic.</span></p><p>The Plane of Fire is dominated by the vast <strong><span class=\"bold\">Cinder Wastes</span></strong>, a great expanse of black cinders and embers crossed by rivers of lava. Roving bands of salamanders battle each other, raid azer outposts, and avoid the efreet. Ancient ruins dot the desert — remnants of forgotten civi<span class=\"No-Break\">lizations.</span></p><p>A great range of volcanic mountains called the <strong><span class=\"bold\">Fountains of Creation</span></strong> is home to azers. These rocky peaks curl from the edge of the Plane of Earth around the Cinder Wastes toward the fiery heart of the plane. At the edge of the plane, the mountains are also called the Plane of Magma. Fire giants and red dragons make their homes here, as well as creatures from the neighbori<span class=\"No-Break\">ng planes.</span></p><p>Lava flows through the volcanoes toward the Plane of Air and pools into a great lava sea, called the <strong><span class=\"bold\">Sea of Fire</span></strong>, sailed by efreet and azers in great brass ships. Islands of obsidian and basalt jut up from the sea, dotted with ancient ruins and the lairs of powerful red dragons. On the shore of the Sea of Fire stands the <strong><span class=\"bold\">City</span><span class=\"No-Break\"><span class=\"bold\"> of Brass</span></span></strong><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><h4>The City of Brass</h4><p>Perhaps the best-known location in the Inner Planes is the City of Brass, on the shores of the Sea of Fire. This is the fabled city of the efreet, and its ornate spires and metal walls reflect their grandiose and cruel nature. True to the nature of the Plane of Fire, everything in the city seems alive with dancing flames, reflecting the vibrant energy of <span class=\"No-Break\">the place.</span></p><p>Adventurers frequently come here on quests for legendary magic. If it’s possible to buy magic items at all, the City of Brass is the most likely place to find any item for sale, though the price might well be more than gold. The efreet are fond of trading in favors, especially when they have the upper hand in negotiations. Perhaps a magical disease or poison can be cured only with something that must be purchased in the bazaars of<span class=\"No-Break\"> the city.</span></p><p>The heart of the city is the towering Charcoal Palace, where the tyrannical sultan of the efreet reigns supreme, surrounded by efreet nobles and a host of slaves, guardians, and s<span class=\"No-Break\">ycophants.</span></p><h3>Plane of Water</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/822/c2-10.png\"></p><p>The nature of water is to flow, not like the gusting wind or the leaping flame, but smoothly and steadily. It is the rhythm of the tide, the nectar of life, the bitter tears of mourning, and the balm of sympathy and healing. Given time, it can erode all in<span class=\"No-Break\"> its path.</span></p><p>A warm sun arcs across the sky of the Plane of Water, seeming to rise and set from within the water at the visible edge of the horizon. Several times a day, however, the sky clouds over and releases a deluge of rain, often accompanied by spectacular shows of lightning, before clearing up again. At night, a glittering array of stars and auroras bedeck<span class=\"No-Break\">s the sky.</span></p><p>The Plane of Water is an endless sea, called the <strong><span class=\"bold\">Sea of Worlds</span></strong>, dotted here and there with atolls and islands that rise up from enormous coral reefs that seem to stretch forever into the depths. The storms that move across the sea sometimes create temporary portals to the Material Plane and draw ships into the Plane of Water. Surviving vessels from countless worlds and navies ply these waters with little hope of ever retur<span class=\"No-Break\">ning home.</span></p><p>The weather on the plane is a lesson in extremes. If the sea isn’t calm, it is battered by storms. On rare occasions, a tremor in the planar firmament sends a rogue wave sweeping across the plane, swamping entire islands and driving ships down to <span class=\"No-Break\">the reefs.</span></p><p>Life flourishes in the upper reaches of the Sea of Worlds, called the <strong><span class=\"bold\">Sea of Light</span></strong> because of the sunlight filtering down into the water. Aquatic humanoids craft castles and fortresses in the coral reefs. The marids are the distant stewards of this region, content to allow the lesser folk to compete for territory. The nominal emperor of the marids dwells in the <strong><span class=\"bold\">Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls</span></strong>, an opulent palace made of coral and studded wi<span class=\"No-Break\">th pearls.</span></p><p>The deeper extents of the plane, where no sunlight reaches, are called the <strong><span class=\"bold\">Darkened Depths</span></strong>. Horrid creatures dwell here, and the absolute cold and crushing pressure mean a swift end to creatures accustomed to the surface or the Sea of Light. Krakens and other mighty leviathans claim t<span class=\"No-Break\">his realm.</span></p><p>Any land that rises above the surface of the sea is hotly contested by the few air-breathers that live on the plane. Fleets of rafts and ships lashed together serve as solid ground where nothing else is available. Most natives of the plane never break the surface of the sea and thus ignore these ha<span class=\"No-Break\">bitations.</span></p><p>One of the few actual islands on the plane is the <strong><span class=\"bold\">Isle of Dread</span></strong>. The island is connected to the Material Plane by means of a regular storm that sweeps over the island. Travelers who know the strange tides and currents of the plane can travel between worlds freely, but the storms also wreck ships from the Material Plane on the islan<span class=\"No-Break\">d’s shore.</span></p><p>The region of the Plane of Water nearest the Swamp of Oblivion (on the Plane of Earth) is called the <strong><span class=\"bold\">Silt Flats</span></strong>. The water is thick with soil and sludge, and turns into muddy ground before giving way to the great swamp between t<span class=\"No-Break\">he planes.</span></p><p>At the other extreme of the plane is the <strong><span class=\"bold\">Sea of Ice</span></strong>, bordering the Frostfell. The frigid water is choked with icebergs and sheet ice, inhabited by the cold-loving creatures that inhabit the Frostfell. Drifting icebergs can carry these creatures farther into the Plane of Water to threaten ships and islands in wa<span class=\"No-Break\">rmer seas.</span></p><p>The <strong><span class=\"bold\">Frostfell</span></strong>, also called the Plane of Ice, forms the border between the planes of Air and Water and is a seemingly endless glacier swept by constant, raging blizzards. Frozen caverns twist through the Plane of Ice, home to yetis, remorhazes, white dragons, and other creatures of cold. The inhabitants of the plane engage in a never-ending battle to prove their strength and ensure their<span class=\"No-Break\"> survival.</span></p><p>Its dangerous monsters and bitter cold make the Frostfell a dangerous place to travel. Most planar voyagers keep to the air, braving the powerful winds and driving snow to avoid setting foot on the grea<span class=\"No-Break\">t glacier.</span></p><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/823/c2-11.png\"></span></p><h2>Outer Planes</h2><blockquote>\n<p>Streamers of noxious gas streaked that crimson dome like dirty clouds. They whirled to form what looked like giant eyes staring down, eyes that were swept away before they could focus, only to form anew, again and again. Beneath the ruby glow lay a dark nightmare land of bare rock and flumes of sparks and gouting flame, where things slithered and scrambled half-seen in the shadows. Mountains clawed the ruby sky. The Land of Teeth, Azuth had once aptly called it, surveying the endless jagged rocks. This was the Greeting Ground, the realm of horror that had claimed the lives of countless mortals. He was whirling along above Avernus, uppermost of the N<span class=\"No-Break\">ine Hells.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Epigraph-Author\"> — Ed Greenwood,</span> <em>Elminst<span class=\"No-Break\">er in Hell</span></em></p>\n</blockquote><p>If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes provide the direction, thought, and purpose for its construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes o<span class=\"No-Break\">f deities.</span></p><p>When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes aren’t literally places at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory e<span class=\"No-Break\">xperience.</span></p><p>Even in perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at a whim of the powerful forces that dwell on these planes, which can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence to better fulfill their div<span class=\"No-Break\">ine needs.</span></p><p>Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes can seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. Adventurers could take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day — if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a sin<span class=\"No-Break\">gle layer.</span></p><p>The default Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality, which is represented by the Outlands, described in the section on “<a title=\"Other Planes\" href=\"#OtherPlanes\">Other Planes</a>”) and the shades of distinction bet<span class=\"No-Break\">ween them.</span></p><h4>The Outer Planes</h4><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Outer

<strong><span class=\"bold\">Upper Planes</span></strong>, while those with an element of evil are the <strong><span class=\"bold\">Lower Planes</span></strong>. A plane’s alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn’t match the plane’s alignment experiences a sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example, it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little unco<span class=\"No-Break\">mfortable.</span></p><p>The Upper Planes are the home of celestial creatures, including angels, couatls, and pegasi. The Lower Planes are the home of fiends: demons, devils, yugoloths, and their ilk. The planes in between host their own unique denizens: the construct race of modrons inhabit Mechanus, and the aberrations called slaadi thrive<span class=\"No-Break\"> in Limbo.</span></p><h3>Layers of the Outer Planes</h3><p>Most of the Outer Planes include a number of distinct environments or realms. These realms are often imagined and depicted as a stack of related parts of the same plane, so travelers refer to them as layers. For example, Mount Celestia resembles a seven-tiered layer cake, the Nine Hells has nine layers, and the Abyss has a seemingly endless number <span class=\"No-Break\">of layers.</span></p><p>Most portals from elsewhere reach the first layer of a multilayered plane. This layer is variously depicted as the top or bottom layer, depending on the plane. As the arrival point for most visitors, the first layer functions like a city gate for t<span class=\"No-Break\">hat plane.</span></p><h3>Traveling the Outer Planes</h3><p>Traveling between the Outer Planes isn’t dissimilar from reaching the Outer Planes in the first place. Characters traveling by means of the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/astral-projection\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"astral projection\">astral projection</a> spell can go from one plane into the Astral Plane, and there search out a color pool leading to the desired destination. Characters can also use <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"plane shift\">plane shift</a> to reach a different plane more directly. Most often, though, characters use portals — either a portal that links the two planes directly or a portal leading to Sigil, City of Doors, which holds portals to all t<span class=\"No-Break\">he planes.</span></p><p>Two planar features connect multiple Outer Planes together: the River Styx and the Infinite Staircase. Other planar crossings might exist in your campaign, such as a World Tree whose roots touch the Lower Planes and whose branches reach to the Upper Planes, or it might be possible to walk from one plane to another in your <span class=\"No-Break\">cosmology.</span></p><h4>The River Styx</h4><p>This river bubbles with grease, foul flotsam, and the putrid remains of battles along its banks. Any creature other than a fiend that tastes or touches the water is affected by a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/feeblemind\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"feeblemind\">feeblemind</a></span> spell. The DC of the Intelligence saving throw to resist the eff<span class=\"No-Break\">ect is 15.</span></p><p>The Styx churns through the top layers of Acheron, the Nine Hells, Gehenna, Hades, Carceri, the Abyss, and Pandemonium. Tributaries of the Styx snake onto lower layers of these planes. For example, a tendril of the Styx winds through every layer of the Nine Hells, allowing passage from one layer of that plane to<span class=\"No-Break\"> the next.</span></p><p>Sinister ferries float on the waters of the Styx, crewed by pilots skilled in negotiating the unpredictable currents and eddies of the river. For a price, these pilots are willing to carry passengers from plane to plane. Some of them are fiends, while others are the souls of dead creatures from the Mater<span class=\"No-Break\">ial Plane.</span></p><h4>The Infinite Staircase</h4><p>The Infinite Staircase is an extradimensional spiral staircase that connects the planes. An entrance to the Infinite Staircase usually appears as a nondescript door. Beyond the portal lies a small landing with an equally nondescript stairway leading up and down. The Infinite Staircase changes appearance as it climbs and descends, going from simple stairs of wood or stone to a chaotic jumble of stairs hanging in radiant space, where no two steps share the same gravitational orientation. It is said that one can find one’s heart’s desire on the Infinite Staircase through diligent searching of eac<span class=\"No-Break\">h landing.</span></p><p>Doors to the Infinite Staircase are often tucked away in dusty, half-forgotten places that no one frequents or pays any attention to. On any given plane, there can be multiple doors to the Infinite Staircase, though entrances aren’t common knowledge and are occasionally guarded by devas, sphinxes, yugoloths, and other powerful<span class=\"No-Break\"> monsters.</span></p><h3>Optional Rules</h3><p>Each of the Outer Planes has peculiar characteristics that make traveling through it a unique experience. A plane’s influence can affect visitors in various ways, such as causing them to take on personality traits or flaws that reflect the disposition of the plane, or even shift alignment to more closely match the native inhabitants of the plane. Each plane’s description includes one or more optional rules that you can use to help make the adventurers’ experiences on that plane <span class=\"No-Break\">memorable.</span></p><h4>Optional Rule: Psychic Dissonance</h4><p>Each of the Outer Planes emanates a psychic dissonance that affects visitors of an incompatible alignment — good creatures on the Lower Planes, evil ones on the Upper Planes — if they spend too much time on the plane. You can reflect this dissonance with this optional rule. At the end of a long rest spent on an incompatible plane, a visitor must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a>. Incompatibility between lawful and chaotic alignments doesn’t have the same effect, so Mechanus and Limbo lack thi<span class=\"No-Break\">s quality.</span></p><h3>Mount Celestia</h3><p>The single sacred mountain of Mount Celestia rises from a shining Silver Sea to heights barely visible and utterly incomprehensible, with seven plateaus marking its seven heavenly layers. The plane is the model of justice and order, of celestial grace and endless mercy, where angels and champions of good guard against incursions of evil. It is one of the few places on the planes where travelers can let down their guard. Its inhabitants strive constantly to be as righteous as possible. Countless creatures aim to reach the highest and most sublime peak of the mountain, but only the purest souls can. Gazing toward that peak fills even the most jaded of travelers<span class=\"No-Break\"> with awe.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/824/c2-12.png\"></p><h4>Optional Rule: Blessed Beneficence</h4><p>In contrast to the dissonance experienced by evil creatures here, good creatures are literally blessed by the pervasive beneficence of the plane. Creatures of good alignment gain the benefit of the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/bless\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"bless\">bless</a></span> spell as long as they remain on the plane. In addition, finishing a long rest on the plane grants a good creature the benefit of a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lesser-restoration\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"lesser restoration\">lesser restoration</a></span><span class=\"No-Break\"> spell.</span></p><h3>Bytopia</h3><p>The two layers of the Twin Paradises of Bytopia are similar yet opposite: one is a tamed, pastoral landscape and the other an untamed wilderness, yet both reflect the plane’s goodness and its acceptance of law and order when necessary. Bytopia is the heaven of productive work, the satisfaction of a job well done. The goodness flowing through the plane creates feelings of goodwill and happiness in creatures dwell<span class=\"No-Break\">ing there.</span></p><h4>Optional Rule: Pervasive Goodwill</h4><p>At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor that is neither lawful good nor neutral good must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s alignment changes to lawful good or neutral good (whichever is closer to the creature’s current alignment). The change becomes permanent if the creature doesn’t leave the plane within 1d4 days. Otherwise, the creature’s alignment reverts to normal after one day spent on a plane other than Bytopia. Casting the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-evil-and-good\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dispel evil and good\">dispel evil and good</a></span> spell on the creature also restores its original <span class=\"No-Break\">alignment.</span></p><h3>Elysium</h3><p>Elysium is home to creatures of unfettered kindness and compassion, and a welcome refuge for planar travelers seeking a safe haven. The plane’s bucolic landscapes glimmer with life and beauty in their prime. Tranquility seeps into the bones and souls of those who enter the plane. It is the heaven of well-earned rest, a place where tears of joy glisten on man<span class=\"No-Break\">y a cheek.</span></p><h4>Optional Rule: Overwhelming Joy</h4><p>Visitors spending any time on this plane risk becoming trapped by overwhelming sensations of contentment and happiness. At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is unwilling to leave the plane before taking another long rest. After three failed saving throws, the creature never willingly leaves the plane and, if forcibly removed, does everything in its power to return to the plane. A <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-evil-and-good\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dispel evil and good\">dispel evil and good</a></span> spell removes this effect from the<span class=\"No-Break\"> creature.</span></p><h3>The Beastlands</h3><p>The Beastlands is a plane of nature unbound, of forests ranging from moss-hung mangroves to snow-laden pines, of thick jungles where the branches are woven so tight that no light penetrates, of vast plains where grains and wildflowers wave in the wind with vibrant life. The plane embodies nature’s wildness and beauty, but it also speaks to the animal within all livi<span class=\"No-Break\">ng things.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/825/c2-13.png\"></p><h4>Optional Rule: Hunter’s Paradise</h4><p>Visitors to the Beastlands find their hunting and stalking capabilities improved, and characters have advantage on Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AnimalHandling\">Animal Handling</a>), Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>), and Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival\">Survival</a>) checks wh<span class=\"No-Break\">ile there.</span></p><h4>Optional Rule: Beast Transformation</h4><p>Whenever a visitor slays a beast native to the plane, the slayer must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or become transformed (as the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/polymorph\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"polymorph\">polymorph</a></span> spell) into the type of beast that was slain. In this form, the creature retains its intelligence and ability to speak. At the end of each long rest, the polymorphed creature can repeat the saving throw. On a successful saving throw, the creature returns to its true form. After three failed saving throws, the transformation can be undone only by a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/remove-curse\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"remove curse\">remove curse</a></span> spell or simi<span class=\"No-Break\">lar magic.</span></p><h3>Arborea</h3><p>Larger than life, Arborea is a place of violent moods and deep affections, of whim backed by steel, and of passions that blaze brightly until they burn out. Its good-natured inhabitants are dedicated to fighting evil, but their reckless emotions sometimes break free with devastating consequences. Rage is as common and as honored as joy in Arborea. There the mountains and forests are extravagantly massive and beautiful, and every glade and stream is inhabited by nature spirits that brook no infringement. Travelers must trea<span class=\"No-Break\">d lightly.</span></p><p>Arborea is home to many elves and elven deities. Elves born on this plane have the celestial type and are wild at heart, ready to battle evil in a heartbeat. Otherwise, they look and behave like nor<span class=\"No-Break\">mal elves.</span></p><h4>Optional Rule: Intense Yearning</h4><p>Keep track of how many days a visitor spends on Arborea. When the visitor leaves, it must make a Charisma saving throw against a DC of 5, plus 1 for each day spent on the plane. On a failed save, the creature becomes afflicted with a yearning to return to Arborea. As long as the effect persists, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks. At the end of each long rest, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. A <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-evil-and-good\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dispel evil and good\">dispel evil and good</a></span> spell removes this effect from the<span class=\"No-Break\"> creature.</span></p><h3>Ysgard</h3><p>Ysgard is a rugged realm of soaring mountains, deep fjords, and windswept battlefields, with summers that are long and hot, and winters that are wickedly cold and unforgiving. Its continents float above oceans of volcanic rock, below which are icy caverns so enormous as to hold entire kingdoms of giants, humans, dwarves, gnomes, and other beings. Heroes come to Ysgard to test their mettle not only against the plane itself, but also against giants, dragons, and other terrible creatures that thunder across Ysgard’s vas<span class=\"No-Break\">t terrain.</span></p><h4>Optional Rule: Immortal Wrath</h4><p>Ysgard is the home of slain heroes who wage eternal battle on fields of glory. Any creature, other than a construct or undead, that is killed by an attack or a spell while on Ysgard is restored to life at dawn the next day. The creature has all its hit points restored, and all conditions and afflictions it suffered before its death ar<span class=\"No-Break\">e removed.</span></p><h3>Limbo</h3><p>Limbo is a plane of pure chaos, a roiling soup of impermanent matter and energy. Stone melts into water that freezes into metal, then turns into diamond that burns up into smoke that becomes snow, and on and on in an endless, unpredictable process of change. Fragments of more ordinary landscapes — bits of forest, meadow, ruined castles, and even burbling streams — drift through the disorder. The whole plane is a nightma<span class=\"No-Break\">rish riot.</span></p><p>Limbo has no gravity, so creatures visiting the plane float in place. A creature can move up to its walking speed in any direction by merely thinking of the desired direction <span class=\"No-Break\">of travel.</span></p><p>Limbo conforms to the will of the creatures inhabiting it. Very disciplined and powerful minds can create whole islands of their own invention within the plane, sometimes maintaining those places for years. A simpleminded creature such as a fish, though, might have less than a minute before the pocket of water surrounding it freezes, vanishes, or turns to glass. The slaadi live here and swim amid this chaos, creating nothing, whereas githzerai monks build entire monasteries with th<span class=\"No-Break\">eir minds.</span></p><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/826/c2-14.png\"></span></p><h4>Optional Rule: Power of the Mind</h4><p>As an action, a creature on Limbo can make an Intelligence check to mentally move an object on the plane that it can see within 30 feet of it. The DC depends on the object’s size: DC 5 for Tiny, DC 10 for Small, DC 15 for Medium, DC 20 for Large, and DC 25 for Huge or larger. On a successful check, the creature moves the object 5 feet plus 1 foot for every point by which it be<span class=\"No-Break\">at the DC.</span></p><p>A creature can also use an action to make an Intelligence check to alter a nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried. The same rules for distance apply, and the DC is based on the object’s size: DC 10 for Tiny, DC 15 for Small, DC 20 for Medium, and DC 25 for Large or larger. On a success, the creature changes the object into another nonliving form of the same size, such as turning a boulder into a bal<span class=\"No-Break\">l of fire.</span></p><p>Finally, a creature can use an action to make an Intelligence check to stabilize a spherical area centered on the creature. The DC depends on the radius of the sphere. The base DC is 5 for a 10-foot-radius sphere; each additional 10 feet added to the radius increases the DC by 5. On a successful check, the creature prevents the area from being altered by the plane for 24 hours, or until the creature uses this abil<span class=\"No-Break\">ity again.</span></p><h3>Pandemonium</h3><p>Pandemonium is a plane of madness, a great mass of rock riddled with tunnels carved by howling winds. It is cold, noisy, and dark, with no natural light. Wind quickly extinguishes nonmagical open flames such as torches and campfires. It also makes conversation possible only by yelling, and even then only to a maximum distance of 10 feet. Creatures have disadvantage on any ability check that relies o<span class=\"No-Break\">n hearing.</span></p><p>Most of the plane’s inhabitants are creatures that were banished to the plane with no hope of escape, and many of them have been driven mad by the incessant winds or forced to take shelter in places where the winds die down until they sound like distant cries o<span class=\"No-Break\">f torment.</span></p><h4>Optional Rule: Mad Winds</h4><p>A visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw after each hour spent among the howling winds. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a>. A creature that reaches six levels of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a> while on this plane doesn’t die. Instead, the creature gains a random form of indefinite madness, as described in chapter 8, “<a title=\"Running the Game\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/running-the-game#Madness\">Running the Game</a>.” Finishing a long rest doesn’t reduce a creature’s <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a> level unless the creature can somehow escape the madden<span class=\"No-Break\">ing winds.</span></p><h3>The Abyss</h3><p>The Abyss embodies all that is perverse, gruesome, and chaotic. Its virtually endless layers spiral downward into ever more appall<span class=\"No-Break\">ing forms.</span></p><p>Each layer of the Abyss boasts its own horrific environment. Although no two layers are alike, they are all harsh and inhospitable. Each layer also reflects the entropic nature of the Abyss. In fact, much of what one sees or touches on the plane seems to be in a decaying, crumbling, or corro<span class=\"No-Break\">ded state.</span></p><h4>Optional Rule: Abyssal Corruption</h4><p>A non-evil visitor that finishes a long rest in the Abyss must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature becomes corrupted. Refer to the Abyssal Corruption table to determine the effects of this corruption. You can substitute different corruption effects of your own<span class=\"No-Break\"> creation.</span></p><p>After finishing a long rest, a corrupted creature can make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the corruption effect ends. A <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-evil-and-good\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dispel evil and good\">dispel evil and good</a> </span>spell or any magic that removes a curse also ends t<span class=\"No-Break\">he effect.</span></p><p>If a corrupted creature doesn’t leave the plane within 1d4 + 2 days, its alignment changes to chaotic evil. Casting the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-evil-and-good\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dispel evil and good\">dispel evil and good</a></span> spell on the creature restores its original <span class=\"No-Break\">alignment.</span></p><h4>Abyssal Corruption</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-699913171\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[xsrwvekI4rfSpaxP]{Result}</span></div></div></div><h4>Important Layers</h4><p>The layers of the Abyss are defined by the demon lords who rule them, as the following examples illustrate. More information about the demon lords can be found in the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/mm/monsters-d#DemonLords\">Monster Manual</a></span>.</p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Gaping Maw.</span></strong> Demogorgon’s layer in the Abyss is a vast wilderness of savagery and madness known as the Gaping Maw, where even powerful demons go insane with fear. Reflecting Demogorgon’s dual nature, the Gaping Maw consists of a massive primeval continent covered in dense jungle, surrounded by a seemingly endless expanse of ocean and brine flats. The Prince of Demons rules his layer from two serpentine towers, which emerge from a turbid sea. Each tower is topped with an enormous fanged skull. The spires constitute the fortress of Abysm, where few creatures can venture without descending int<span class=\"No-Break\">o madness.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Thanatos.</span></strong> If Orcus had his way, all planes would resemble his dead realm of Thanatos, and all creatures would become undead under his control. Under its black sky, Thanatos is a land of bleak mountains, barren moors, ruined cities, and forests of twisted black trees. Tombs, mausoleums, gravestones, and sarcophagi litter the landscape. Undead swarm across the plane, bursting from their tombs and graves to tear apart any creatures foolish enough to journey here. Orcus rules Thanatos from a vast palace known as Everlost, crafted of obsidian and bone. Set within a howling wasteland called Oblivion’s End, the palace is surrounded by tombs and burial sites dug into the sheer slopes of narrow valleys, creating a tiered n<span class=\"No-Break\">ecropolis.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The Demonweb.</span></strong> Lolth’s layer is an immense network of thick, magical webbing that forms passageways and cocoon-like chambers. Throughout the web, buildings, structures, ships, and other objects hang as if caught in a spider’s snare. The nature of Lolth’s web creates random portals throughout the plane, drawing such objects in from demiplanes and Material Plane worlds that figure into the schemes of the Spider Queen. Lolth’s servants also build dungeons amid the webbing, trapping and hunting Lolth’s hated enemies within crisscrossing corridors of web-morta<span class=\"No-Break\">red stone.</span></p><p>Far beneath these dungeons lie the bottomless Demonweb Pits where the Spider Queen dwells. There, Lolth is surrounded by her handmaidens — yochlol demons created to serve her and which outrank mightier demons while in the Spider Quee<span class=\"No-Break\">n’s realm.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Endless Maze.</span></strong> Baphomet’s layer of the Abyss is a never-ending dungeon, the center of which holds the Horned King’s enormous ziggurat palace. A confusing jumble of crooked hallways and myriad chambers, the palace is surrounded by a mile-wide moat concealing a maddening series of submerged stairs and tunnels leading deeper into the<span class=\"No-Break\"> fortress.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Triple Realm.</span></strong> The Dark Prince Graz’zt rules over the realm of Azzagrat, which encompasses three layers of the Abyss. His seat of power is the fantastic Argent Palace in the city of Zelatar, whose bustling markets and pleasure palaces draw visitors from across the multiverse in search of obscure magical lore and perverse delights. By Graz’zt’s command, the demons of Azzagrat present a veneer of civility and courtly comity. However, the so-called Triple Realm holds as much danger as any other part of the Abyss, and planar visitors can vanish without a trace in its mazelike cities and in forests whose trees have serpents for<span class=\"No-Break\"> branches.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Death Dells.</span></strong> Yeenoghu rules a layer of ravines known as Death Dells. Here, creatures must hunt to survive. Even the plants, which must bathe their roots in blood, snare the unwary. Yeenoghu’s servants, helping to sate their master’s hunger as he prowls his kingdom seeking prey, capture creatures from the Material Plane for release in the Gnoll Lor<span class=\"No-Break\">d’s realm.</span></p><h3>Carceri</h3><p>The model for all other prisons in existence, Carceri is a plane of desolation and despair. Its six layers hold vast bogs, fetid jungles, windswept deserts, jagged mountains, frigid oceans, and black ice. All form a miserable home for the traitors and backstabbers that are trapped on this pri<span class=\"No-Break\">son plane.</span></p><h4>Optional Rule: Prison Plane</h4><p>No one can leave Carceri easily. Magical efforts to leave the plane by any spell other than a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wish\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"wish\">wish</a></span> simply fail. Portals and gates that open onto the plane become one-way only. Secret ways out of the plane exist, but they are hidden and well guarded by traps and deadly<span class=\"No-Break\"> monsters.</span></p><h3>Hades</h3><p>The layers of Hades are called the Three Glooms — places without joy, hope, or passion. A gray land with an ashen sky, Hades is the destination of many souls that are unclaimed by the gods of the Upper Planes or the fiendish rulers of the Lower Planes. These souls become larvae and spend eternity in this place that lacks a sun, a moon, stars, or seasons. Leaching away color and emotion, this gloom is more than most visitors can stand. The “<a title=\"Shadowfell Despair\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#ShadowfellDespair\">Shadowfell Despair</a>” rule earlier in this chapter can be used to represent a visitor’<span class=\"No-Break\">s despair.</span></p><div class=\"Basic-Text-Frame\">\n<p id=\"Larva\" class=\"Stat-Block-Styles_Stat-Block-Title\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/larva\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"Larva\">Larva</a></p>\n<p class=\"Stat-Block-Styles_Stat-Block-Data\"><em>Medium fiend, neutral evil</em></p>\n<p class=\"Stat-Block-Styles_Stat-Block-Data\"><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Armor Class</span>&nbsp;9&nbsp;<br><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Hit Points</span> 9 (2d8)<br><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Speed</span> 20 ft.</p>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores\">\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-stat\">\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-heading\">STR</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-data\"><span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-score\">9</span><span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-modifier\">(-1)</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-stat\">\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-heading\">DEX</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-data\"><span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-score\">9</span><span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-modifier\">(-1)</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-stat\">\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-heading\">CON</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-data\"><span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-score\">10</span><span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-modifier\">(+0)</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-stat\">\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-heading\">INT</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-data\"><span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-score\">6</span><span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-modifier\">(-2)</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-stat\">\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-heading\">WIS</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-data\"><span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-score\">10</span><span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-modifier\">(+0)</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-stat\">\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-heading\">CHA</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-data\"><span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-score\">2</span><span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-modifier\">(-4)</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"Stat-Block-Styles_Stat-Block-Data\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\"><br>Senses</span></strong> passive Per<span class=\"No-Break\">ception 10</span></p>\n<p class=\"Stat-Block-Styles_Stat-Block-Data\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Languages</span></strong> understands the languages it knew in life but c<span class=\"No-Break\">an’t speak</span></p>\n<p class=\"Stat-Block-Styles_Stat-Block-Data\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Challenge</span></strong> <span class=\"No-Break\">0</span><span class=\"No-Break\"> (10 XP)</span></p>\n<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Bite.</span></strong> <span class=\"italic\">Melee Weapon Attack:</span> +1 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <span class=\"italic\">Hit: </span>1 (1d4 − 1) pierci<span class=\"No-Break\">ng damage.<br><br></span></p>\n</div><h4>Optional Rule: Vile Transformation</h4><p>At the end of each long rest taken on the plane, a visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a>, which can’t be removed while the creature remains in Hades. If the creature reaches six levels of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a>, it doesn’t die. Instead, the creature permanently transforms into a larva, whereupon all levels of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a> afflicting the creature ar<span class=\"No-Break\">e removed.</span></p><p>A larva is a miserable fiend that retains the facial features of its previous form but has the body of a fat worm. A larva has only a few faint memories of its previous life and the statistics in the larva s<span class=\"No-Break\">tat block.</span></p><p>Hades is crawling with larvae. Night hags, liches, and rakshasas harvest them for use in vile rituals. Other fiends like to fee<span class=\"No-Break\">d on them.</span></p><h3>Gehenna</h3><p>Gehenna is the plane of suspicion and greed. It is the birthplace of the yugoloths, which dwell here in great numbers. A volcanic mountain dominates each of the four layers of Gehenna, and lesser volcanic earthbergs drift in the air and smash into the greater <span class=\"No-Break\">mountains.</span></p><p>The rocky slopes of the plane make movement here difficult and dangerous. The ground inclines at least 45 degrees almost everywhere. In places, steep cliffs and deep canyons present more challenging obstacles. Hazards include volcanic fissures that vent noxious fumes or seari<span class=\"No-Break\">ng flames.</span></p><p>Gehenna has no room for mercy or compassion. The fiends living here are among the greediest and most selfish in all the m<span class=\"No-Break\">ultiverse.</span></p><h4>Optional Rule: Cruel Hindrance</h4><p>The plane’s cruel nature makes it difficult for visitors to help one another. Whenever a visitor casts a spell with a beneficial effect, including a spell that restores hit points or removes a condition, the caster must first make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the spell fails, the spell slot is expended, and the action <span class=\"No-Break\">is wasted.</span></p><h3>The Nine Hells</h3><p>The Nine Hells of Baator inflame the imaginations of travelers, the greed of treasure seekers, and the battle fury of all moral creatures. It is the ultimate plane of law and evil and the epitome of premeditated cruelty. The devils of the Nine Hells are bound to obey the laws of their superiors, but they rebel within their individual castes. Most undertake any plot, no matter how foul, to advance themselves. At the very top of the hierarchy is Asmodeus, who has yet to be bested. If he were to be vanquished, the victor would rule the plane in turn. Such is the law of the N<span class=\"No-Break\">ine Hells.</span></p><h4>Optional Rule: Pervasive Evil</h4><p>Evil pervades the Nine Hells, and visitors to this plane feel its influence. At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor that isn’t evil must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s alignment changes to lawful evil. The change becomes permanent if the creature doesn’t leave the plane within 1d4 days. Otherwise, the creature’s alignment reverts to normal after one day spent on a plane other than the Nine Hells. Casting the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-evil-and-good\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dispel evil and good\">dispel evil and good</a></span> spell on the creature also restores its original <span class=\"No-Break\">alignment.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/827/c2-15.png\"></p><h4>The Nine Layers</h4><p>The Nine Hells has nine layers. The first eight are each ruled by archdevils that answer to Asmodeus, the Archduke of Nessus, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of tha<span class=\"No-Break\">t journey.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Avernus. </span></strong>No planar portals connect directly to the lower layers of the Nine Hells, by Asmodeus’s orders. As such, the first layer of Avernus is the arrival point for visitors to the plane. Avernus is a rocky wasteland with rivers of blood and clouds of biting flies. Fiery comets occasionally fall from the darkened sky and leave fuming impact craters behind. Empty battlefields are littered with weapons and bones, showing where the legions of the Nine Hells met enemies on their native soil and <span class=\"No-Break\">prevailed.</span></p><p>The archduchess Zariel rules Avernus, supplanting her rival, Bel, who has fallen out of Asmodeus’s favor and is forced to serve as Zariel’s advisor. Tiamat, the Queen of Evil Dragons, is a prisoner on this layer, ruling her own domain but confined to the Nine Hells by Asmodeus in accordance with some ancient contract (the terms of which are known only to Tiamat and the Lords of <span class=\"No-Break\">the Nine).</span></p><p>Zariel’s seat of power is a soaring basalt citadel festooned with the partially incinerated corpses of guests who failed to earn the archduchess’s favor. Zariel appears as an angel whose once-beautiful skin and wings have been ruined by fire. Her eyes burn with a furious white light that can cause creatures looking upon her to burst i<span class=\"No-Break\">nto flame.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Dis.</span></strong> Dis, the second layer of the Nine Hells, is a labyrinth of canyons wedged between sheer mountains rich with iron ore. Iron roads span and wend through the canyons, watched over by the garrisons of iron fortresses perched atop jagged <span class=\"No-Break\">pinnacles.</span></p><p>The second layer takes its name from its current lord, Dispater. A manipulator and deceiver, the archduke is devilishly handsome, bearing only small horns, a tail, and a cloven left hoof to distinguish him from a human. His crimson throne stands in the heart of the Iron City of Dis, a hideous metropolis that is the largest in the Nine Hells. Planar travelers come here to conspire with devils and to close deals with night hags, rakshasas, incubi, succubi, and other fiends. Dispater collects a piece of every deal through special provisions that are added to contracts signed on his layer of the N<span class=\"No-Break\">ine Hells.</span></p><p>Dispater is one of Asmodeus’s most loyal and resourceful vassals, and few beings in the multiverse can outwit him. He is more obsessed than most devils with striking deals with mortals in exchange for their souls, and his emissaries work tirelessly to foster evil schemes in the Mater<span class=\"No-Break\">ial Plane.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Minauros.</span></strong> The third layer of the Nine Hells is a stench-ridden bog. Acidic rain spills from the layer’s brown skies, thick layers of scum cover its putrid surface, and yawning pits lie in wait beneath the murk to engulf careless wanderers. Cyclopean cities of ornately carved stone rise up from the bog, including the great city of Minauros for which the layer<span class=\"No-Break\"> is named.</span></p><p>The slimy walls of the city rise hundreds of feet into the air, protecting the flooded halls of Mammon. The Archduke of Minauros resembles a massive serpent with the upper torso and head of a hairless, horned humanoid. Mammon’s greed is legendary, and he is one of the few archdevils who will trade favors for gold instead of souls. His lair is piled high with treasures left behind by those who tried — and failed — to best him <span class=\"No-Break\">in a deal.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Phlegethos.</span></strong> Phlegethos, the fourth layer, is a fiery landscape whose seas of molten magma brew hurricanes of hot wind, choking smoke, and pyroclastic ash. Within the fire-filled caldera of Phlegethos’s largest volcano rises Abriymoch, a fortress city cast of obsidian and dark glass. With rivers of molten lava pouring down its outer walls, the city resembles the sculpted centerpiece of a gigantic, hellish<span class=\"No-Break\"> fountain.</span></p><p>Abriymoch is the seat of power for the two archdevils who rule Phlegethos in tandem: Archduke Belial and Archduchess Fierna, Belial’s daughter. Belial is a handsome, powerfully built devil who exudes civility, even as his words carry an undercurrent of threat. His daughter is a statuesque devil whose beauty encases the blackest heart in the Nine Hells. The alliance of Belial and Fierna is unbreakable, for both are aware that their mutual survival hin<span class=\"No-Break\">ges on it.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Stygia.</span></strong> The fifth layer of the Nine Hells is a freezing realm of ice within which cold flames burn. A frozen sea surrounds the layer, and its gloomy sky crackles with <span class=\"No-Break\">lightning.</span></p><p>Archduke Levistus once betrayed Asmodeus and is now encased deep in the ice of Stygia as punishment. He rules this layer all the same, communicating telepathically with his followers and servants, both in the Nine Hells and on the Mater<span class=\"No-Break\">ial Plane.</span></p><p>Stygia is also home to its previous ruler, the serpentine archdevil Geryon, who was dismissed by Asmodeus to allow the imprisoned Levistus to regain his rule. Geryon’s fall from grace has spurred much debate within the infernal courts. No one is certain whether Asmodeus had some secret cause to dismiss the archdevil or whether he is testing Geryon’s allegiance for some greate<span class=\"No-Break\">r purpose.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Malbolge.</span></strong> Malbolge, the sixth layer, has outlasted many rulers, among them Malagard the Hag Countess and the archdevil Moloch. Malagard fell out of favor and was struck down by Asmodeus in a fit of pique, while her predecessor, Moloch, still lingers somewhere on the sixth layer as an imp, plotting to regain Asmodeus’s favor. Malbolge is a seemingly endless slope, like the sides of an impossibly huge mountain. Parts of the layer break off from time to time, creating deadly and deafening avalanches of stone. The inhabitants of Malbolge live in crumbling fortresses and great caves carved into the mou<span class=\"No-Break\">ntainside.</span></p><p>Malbolge’s current archduchess is Asmodeus’s daughter, Glasya. She resembles a succubus with her small horns, leathery wings, and forked tail. She inherited her cruelty and love of dark schemes from her father. The citadel that serves as her domicile on the slopes of Malbolge is supported by cracked pillars and buttresses that are sturdy yet seem on the verge of collapse. Beneath the palace is a labyrinth lined with cells and torture chambers, where Glasya confines and torments those who disp<span class=\"No-Break\">lease her.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Maladomini.</span></strong> The seventh layer, Maladomini, is ruin-covered wasteland. Dead cities form a desolate urban landscape, and between them lie empty quarries, crumbling roads, slag heaps, the hollow shells of empty fortresses, and swarms of hun<span class=\"No-Break\">gry flies.</span></p><p>The Archduke of Maladomini is Baalzebul, the Lord of Flies. A bloated fiend with the lower body of an enormous slug, Baalzebul’s form was inflicted on him by Asmodeus as punishment for wavering loyalty. Baalzebul is a miserable and degenerate monstrosity who has long conspired to usurp Asmodeus, yet has failed at every turn. He carries a curse that causes any deal made with him to lead to calamity. Asmodeus occasionally shows Baalzebul favor for reasons no other archduke can fathom, though some suspect that the Archduke of Nessus still respects the worthiness of this fallen <span class=\"No-Break\">adversary.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Cania.</span></strong> Cania, the eighth layer of the Nine Hells, is an icy hellscape, whose ice storms can tear flesh from bone. Cities embedded in the ice provide shelter for guests and prisoners of Cania’s ruler, the brilliant and conniving archdevil Mephi<span class=\"No-Break\">stopheles.</span></p><p>Mephistopheles dwells in the ice citadel of Mephistar, where he plots to seize the Throne of Baator and conquer the planes. He is Asmodeus’s greatest enemy and ally, and the Archduke of Nessus appears to trust Mephistopheles’s counsel when it is offered. Mephistopheles knows he can’t depose Asmodeus until his adversary makes a grave miscalculation, and so both wait to see what circumstances might turn them against each other. Mephistopheles is also a godfather of sorts to Glasya, further complicating the rel<span class=\"No-Break\">ationship.</span></p><p>Mephistopheles is a tall, striking devil with impressive horns and a cool demeanor. He trades in souls, as do other archdevils, but he rarely gives his time to any creatures not worthy of his personal attention. His instincts are as razor sharp as Cania’s frigid winds, and it is said that only Asmodeus has ever deceived or thw<span class=\"No-Break\">arted him.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Nessus.</span></strong> The lowest layer of the Nine Hells, Nessus is a realm of dark pits whose walls are set with fortresses. There, pit fiend generals loyal to Asmodeus garrison their diabolical legions and plot the conquest of the multiverse. At the center of the layer stands a vast rift of unknown depth, out of which rises the great citadel-spire of Malsheem, home to Asmodeus and his infer<span class=\"No-Break\">nal court.</span></p><p>Malsheem resembles a gigantic hollowed-out stalagmite. The citadel is also a prison for souls that Asmodeus has locked away for safekeeping. Convincing him to release even one of those souls comes at a steep price, and it is rumored that the Archduke of Nessus has claimed whole kingdoms in the past for su<span class=\"No-Break\">ch favors.</span></p><p>Asmodeus most often appears as a handsome, bearded humanoid with small horns protruding from his forehead, piercing red eyes, and flowing robes. He can also assume other forms and is seldom seen without his ruby-tipped scepter in hand. Asmodeus is the most cunning and well-mannered of archdevils. The ultimate evil he represents can be seen only when he wills it so, or if he forgets himself and flies in<span class=\"No-Break\">to a rage.</span></p><h3>Acheron</h3><p>Acheron has four layers, each made of enormous iron cubes floating in an airy void. Sometimes the cubes collide. Echoes of past collisions linger throughout the plane, mingling with the sounds of armies colliding. That’s the nature of Acheron: strife and war, as the spirits of fallen soldiers join in endless battle against orcs devoted to Gruumsh, goblinoids loyal to Maglubiyet, and legions assembled by other warmonge<span class=\"No-Break\">ring gods.</span></p><h4>Optional Rule: Bloodlust</h4><p>Acheron rewards a creature for harming other creatures by imbuing that creature with the strength to keep fighting. While on Acheron, a creature gains temporary hit points equal to half its hit point maximum whenever it reduces a hostile creature to 0 h<span class=\"No-Break\">it points.</span></p><h3>Mechanus</h3><p>On Mechanus, law is reflected in a realm of clockwork gears, all interlocked and turning according to their measure. The cogs seem to be engaged in a calculation so vast that no deity can fathom its purpose. Mechanus embodies absolute order, and its influence can be felt on those who spend <span class=\"No-Break\">time here.</span></p><p>Modrons are the primary inhabitants of Mechanus. The plane is also home to the creator of the modrons: a godlike being call<span class=\"No-Break\">ed Primus.</span></p><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/828/c2-16.png\"></span></p><h4>Optional Rule: Law of Averages</h4><p>While on Mechanus, creatures always use the average damage result for attacks and spells. For example, an attack that normally deals 1d10 + 5 damage always deals 10 damage on<span class=\"No-Break\"> Mechanus.</span></p><h4>Optional Rule: Imposing Order</h4><p>At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor that isn’t lawful neutral must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s alignment changes to lawful neutral. The creature’s alignment reverts to normal after one day spent on a plane other than Mechanus. Casting the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-evil-and-good\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dispel evil and good\">dispel evil and good</a></span> spell on the creature also restores its original <span class=\"No-Break\">alignment.</span></p><h3>Arcadia</h3><p>Arcadia thrives with orchards of perfectly lined trees, ruler-straight streams, orderly fields, perfect roads, and cities laid out in geometrically pleasing shapes. The mountains are unblemished by erosion. Everything on Arcadia works toward the common good and a flawless form of existence. Here, purity is eternal, and nothing intrudes o<span class=\"No-Break\">n harmony.</span></p><p>Night and day are determined by an orb that floats above Arcadia’s highest peak. Half of the orb radiates sunlight and brings about the day; the other half sheds moonlight and brings on the starry night. The orb rotates evenly without fail, spreading day and night across the ent<span class=\"No-Break\">ire plane.</span></p><p>The weather in Arcadia is governed by four allied demigods called the Storm Kings: the Cloud King, the Wind Queen, the Lightning King, and the Rain Queen. Each one lives in a castle surrounded by the type of weather that king or queen<span class=\"No-Break\"> controls.</span></p><p>Hidden below Arcadia’s beautiful mountains are numerous dwarven kingdoms that have withstood the passage of millennia. Dwarves born on this plane have the celestial type and are always brave and kindhearted, but otherwise they look and behave like norma<span class=\"No-Break\">l dwarves.</span></p><h4>Optional Rule: Planar Vitality</h4><p>While on this plane, creatures can’t be <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Poisoned\">poisoned</a>, and they are immune to disease a<span class=\"No-Break\">nd poison.</span></p><h2>Other Planes</h2><p>A variety of realms exist between or beyond the oth<span class=\"No-Break\">er planes.</span></p><h3>The Outlands and Sigil</h3><p>The Outlands is the plane between the Outer Planes. It is the plane of neutrality, incorporating a little of everything and keeping all aspects in a paradoxical balance — simultaneously concordant and in opposition. The plane has varied terrain, with prairies, mountains, and shall<span class=\"No-Break\">ow rivers.</span></p><p>The Outlands is circular, like a great disk. In fact, those who envision the Outer Planes as a wheel point to the Outlands as proof, calling it a microcosm of the planes. That argument might be circular, since the arrangement of the Outlands inspired the idea of the Great Wheel in the fi<span class=\"No-Break\">rst place.</span></p><p>Around the outside edge of the circle, evenly spaced, are the gate-towns: sixteen settlements, each built around a portal leading to one of the Outer Planes. Each town shares many of the characteristics of the plane where its gate leads. Planar emissaries often meet in these towns, so it isn’t unusual to see strange pairings, such as a celestial and a fiend arguing in a tavern while sharing a fine bottle of wine.</p><p>Given the fact that you can ride a horse in the Outlands from a heaven to a hell, a planar-themed campaign can be set there without the need for planar travel. The Outlands is the closest the Outer Planes come to being like a world on the Material Plane.</p><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img

Outlands, like the axle of a great wheel, is the Spire — a needle-shaped mountain that rises high into the sky. Above this mountain’s narrow peak floats the ring-shaped city of Sigil, its myriad structures built on the ring’s inner rim. Creatures standing on one of Sigil’s streets can see the city curve up over their heads and — most disconcerting of all — the far side of the city directly overhead. Called the City of Doors, this bustling planar metropolis holds countless portals to other planes a<span class=\"No-Break\">nd worlds.</span></p><p>Sigil is a trader’s paradise. Goods, merchandise, and information come here from across the planes. The city sustains a brisk trade in information about the planes, particularly the command words or items required for the operation of particular portals. Portal keys of all kinds are bought and <span class=\"No-Break\">sold here.</span></p><p>The city is the domain of the inscrutable Lady of Pain, a being as old as gods and with purposes unknown to even the sages of her city. Is Sigil her prison? Is she the fallen creator of the multiverse? No one knows. Or if they do, they aren’<span class=\"No-Break\">t telling.</span></p><h3>Demiplanes</h3><p>Demiplanes are extradimensional spaces that come into being by a variety of means and boast their own physical laws. Some are created by spells. Others exist naturally, as folds of reality pinched off from the rest of the multiverse. Theoretically, a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"plane shift\">plane shift</a> spell can carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork would be extremely hard to acquire. The <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gate\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"gate\">gate</a> spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.</p><p>A demiplane can be as small as a single chamber or large enough to contain an entire realm. For example, a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mordenkainens-magnificent-mansion\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"Mordenkainen’s magnificent mansion\">Mordenkainen’s magnificent mansion</a> spell creates a demiplane consisting of a foyer with multiple adjoining rooms, while the land of Barovia (in the Ravenloft setting) exists entirely within a demiplane under the sway of its vampire lord, Strahd von Zarovich. When a demiplane is connected to the Material Plane or some other plane, entering it can be as simple as stepping through a portal or passing through a wall of mist.</p><h3>The Far Realm</h3><p>The Far Realm is outside the known multiverse. In fact, it might be an entirely separate universe with its own physical and magical laws. Where stray energies from the Far Realm leak onto another plane, matter is warped into alien shapes that defy understandable geometry and biology. Aberrations such as mind flayers and beholders are either from this plane or shaped by its strange <span class=\"No-Break\">influence.</span></p><p>The entities that abide in the Far Realm itself are too alien for a normal mind to accept without strain. Titanic creatures swim through nothingness there, and unspeakable things whisper awful truths to those who dare listen. For mortals, knowledge of the Far Realm is a struggle of the mind to overcome the boundaries of matter, space, and sanity. Some warlocks embrace this struggle by forming pacts with entities there. Anyone who has seen the Far Realm mutters about eyes, tentacles, a<span class=\"No-Break\">nd horror.</span></p><p>The Far Realm has no well-known portals, or at least none that are still viable. Ancient elves once opened a vast portal to the Far Realm within a mountain called Firestorm Peak, but their civilization imploded in bloody terror and the portal’s location — even its home world — is long forgotten. Lost portals might still exist, marked by an alien magic that mutates the area ar<span class=\"No-Break\">ound them.</span></p><h2>Known Worlds of the Material Plane</h2><p>Worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse. The most widely known worlds are the ones that have been published as official campaign settings for the D&amp;D game over the years. If your campaign takes place on one of these worlds, that world belongs to you in your campaign. Your version of the world can diverge wildly from what’s<span class=\"No-Break\"> in print.</span></p><p>On <strong><span class=\"bold\">Toril</span></strong> (the heroic-fantasy world of the Forgotten Realms setting), fantastic cities and kingdoms stand amid the remains of ancient empires and realms long forgotten. The world is vast, its dungeons rich with history. Beyond the central continent of Faerûn, Toril includes the regions of Al-Qadim, Kara-Tur, an<span class=\"No-Break\">d Maztica.</span></p><p>On <strong><span class=\"bold\">Oerth</span></strong> (the sword-and-sorcery world of the Greyhawk setting), heroes such as Bigby and Mordenkainen are driven by greed or ambition. The hub of the region called the Flanaess is the Free City of Greyhawk, a city of scoundrels and archmagi, rife with adventure. An evil demigod, Iuz, rules a nightmarish realm in the north, threatening all civ<span class=\"No-Break\">ilization.</span></p><p>On <strong><span class=\"bold\">Krynn</span></strong> (the epic-fantasy world of the Dragonlance setting), the return of the gods is overshadowed by the rise of the evil dragon queen Takhisis and her dragons and dragonarmies, which plunge the continent of Ansalon<span class=\"No-Break\"> into war.</span></p><p>On <strong><span class=\"bold\">Athas</span></strong> (the sword-and-sorcery world of the Dark Sun setting), a drop of water can be worth more than a human life. The gods have abandoned this desert world, where powerful sorcerer-kings rule as tyrants, and metal is a scarce and precious <span class=\"No-Break\">commodity.</span></p><p>On <strong><span class=\"bold\">Eberron</span></strong> (the heroic-fantasy world of the Eberron setting), a terrible war has ended, giving rise to a cold war fueled by political intrigue. On the continent of Khorvaire, magic is commonplace, dragonmarked houses rival kingdoms in power, and elemental vehicles make travel to the far corners of the world<span class=\"No-Break\"> possible.</span></p><p>On <strong><span class=\"bold\">Aebrynis</span></strong> (the heroic-fantasy world of the Birthright setting), scions born from divine bloodlines carve up the continent of Cerilia. Monarchs, prelates, guildmasters, and great wizards balance the demands of rulership against the threat of horrible abominations born from the blood of an<span class=\"No-Break\"> evil god.</span></p><p>On <strong><span class=\"bold\">Mystara</span></strong> (a heroic-fantasy world born out of the earliest editions of the D&amp;D game), diverse cultures, savage monsters, and warring empires collide. The world is further shaped by the meddling of the Immortals — former adventurers raised to nearly divi<span class=\"No-Break\">ne status.</span></p>","img":null,"_id":"vBlrJoiQXQ5db4K7"}
{"name":" 04 Chapter 3: Creating Adventures","permission":{"default":0,"DJNYgTCLxATVgLjS":3},"flags":{"vtta":{"name":"04 Chapter 3: Creating Adventures","sceneId":null}},"content":"<h1>Chapter 3: Creating Adventures</h1><p>Creating adventures is one of the greatest rewards of being a Dungeon Master. It’s a way to express yourself, designing fantastic locations and encounters with monsters, traps, puzzles, and conflicts. When you design an adventure, you call the shots. You do things exactly the way yo<span class=\"No-Break\">u want to.</span></p><p>Fundamentally, adventures are stories. An adventure shares many of the features of a novel, a movie, an issue of a comic, or an episode of a TV show. Comic series and serialized TV dramas are particularly good comparisons, because of the way individual adventures are limited in scope but blend together to create a larger narrative. If an adventure is a single issue or episode, a campaign is the series a<span class=\"No-Break\">s a whole.</span></p><p>Whether you’re creating your own adventures or using published adventures, you’ll find advice in&nbsp;this chapter to help you create a fun and memorable experience for you<span class=\"No-Break\">r players.</span></p><p>Creating an adventure involves blending scenes of exploration, social interaction, and combat into a unified whole that meets the needs of your players and your campaign. But it’s more than that. The basic elements of good storytelling should guide you throughout this process, so your players experience the adventure as a story and not a disjointed series of e<span class=\"No-Break\">ncounters.</span></p><h2>Elements of a Great Adventure</h2><p>The best adventures have several things <span class=\"No-Break\">in common.</span></p><h4>A Credible Threat</h4><p>An adventure needs a threat worthy of the heroes’ attention. The threat might be a single villain or monster, a villain with lackeys, an assortment of monsters, or an evil organization. Whatever their nature, the antagonists should have goals that the heroes can uncover a<span class=\"No-Break\">nd thwart.</span></p><h4>Familiar Tropes with Clever Twists</h4><p>It might seem stereotypical to build an adventure around dragons, orcs, and insane wizards in towers, but these are staples of fantasy storytelling. It might also seem trite to begin an adventure in a tavern, but that’s an idea that remains true to D&amp;D. Familiar story elements are fine, as long as you and the players occasionally put a spin on them. For example, the mysterious figure who presents adventurers with a quest on behalf of the king might be the king in disguise. The crazy wizard in the tower might be a projected illusion created by a band of greedy gnome thieves to guard t<span class=\"No-Break\">heir loot.</span></p><h4>A Clear Focus on the Present</h4><p>An adventure is about the here and now. A little bit of history might be needed to set the story in motion, and the adventurers might discover interesting lore of the past in the course of the adventure. In general, let the world’s history be evident in the present situation. Instead of dealing with what happened in the past, an adventure should focus on describing the present situation, what the bad guys are up to, and how the adventurers become involved in <span class=\"No-Break\">the story.</span></p><h4>Heroes Who Matter</h4><p>An adventure should allow the adventurers’ actions and decisions to matter. Though it might resemble a novel or a TV episode, an adventure needs to allow for more than one outcome. Otherwise, players can feel as if they’ve been railroaded — set onto a course that has only one destination, no matter how hard they try to change it. For example, if a major villain shows up before the end of the adventure, the adventure should allow for the possibility that the heroes might defeat tha<span class=\"No-Break\">t villain.</span></p><h4>Something for All Player Types</h4><p>As outlined in the book’s introduction, players come to the gaming table with different expectations. An adventure needs to account for the different players and characters in your group, drawing them into the story as effectively as<span class=\"No-Break\"> possible.</span></p><p>As a starting point, think about your adventure in terms of the three basic types of activity in the game: exploration, social interaction, and combat. If your adventure includes a balance of all three, it’s likely to appeal to all types o<span class=\"No-Break\">f players.</span></p><p>An adventure you create for your home campaign doesn’t have to appeal to every abstract player type — only to the players sitting down at your own table. If you don’t have any players who like fighting above all else, then don’t feel you have to provide a maximum amount of combat to keep the adventu<span class=\"No-Break\">re moving.</span></p><h4>Surprises</h4><p>Look for opportunities to surprise and delight your players. For example, the exploration of a ruined castle on a hill might lead to the discovery of a dragon’s tomb hidden underneath. A trek through the wilderness might lead to the discovery of a tower that appears only on nights of the full moon. Players remember such <span class=\"No-Break\">locations.</span></p><p>Too many surprises can be off-putting to players, but adding the occasional twist gets players to adjust their tactics and think creatively. For example, you could spruce up a goblin lair by including goblin sappers with kegs of oil strapped to their backs. An attack on a villain’s estate might be complicated by the unexpected arrival of a spec<span class=\"No-Break\">ial guest.</span></p><p>When preparing for possible combat encounters, think about odd pairings of monsters, such as a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hobgoblin\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"hobgoblin\">hobgoblin</a> warlord and his pet <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/manticore\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"manticore\">manticore</a>, or <span class=\"plural-monster-tooltip\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/will-o-wisp\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"will-o’-wisp\">will-o’-wisp</a>s</span> in league with a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/young-black-dragon\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"young black dragon\">young black dragon</a>. Have surprise reinforcements show up, or give the monsters unusual tactics. Throw in the occasional red herring, deception, and plot twist to keep players on their toes, but try not to go overboard. Sometimes a simple, straightforward encounter with an orc guard is just as fun for you<span class=\"No-Break\">r players.</span></p><h4>Useful Maps</h4><p>A good adventure needs thoughtfully constructed maps. Wilderness areas sprinkled with interesting landmarks and other features are better than vast expanses of unchanging terrain. Dungeons that have branching corridors and similar decision points give players the opportunity to choose which direction their characters should go. Presenting the characters with options allows the players to make choices that keep the adventure unpr<span class=\"No-Break\">edictable.</span></p><p>If drawing maps isn’t your strong suit, the Internet is a great place to look for adventure maps that have been made freely available for use, as well as floor plans of real-world buildings and images that can inspire your mapmaking. You can also use software to help put your maps<span class=\"No-Break\"> together.</span></p><h2>Published Adventures</h2><p>Published adventures are available for purchase if you have neither the time nor the inclination to write an adventure of your own, or if you want a change of pace. A published adventure includes a pregenerated scenario with the maps, NPCs, monsters, and treasures you need to run it. An example of a published adventure appears in the <span class=\"italic\">D&amp;D Starter Set</span><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><p>You can make adjustments to a published adventure so that it better suits your campaign and appeals to your players. For example, you can replace the villain of an adventure with one the players have already encountered in your campaign, or add something to the background of the adventure so that it involves your players’ characters in ways that the adventure’s designer never could have<span class=\"No-Break\"> imagined.</span></p><p>A published adventure can’t account for every action the characters might take. The nice thing about published adventures is that they allow you to focus your game preparation time on highlighting plot developments in your campaign that the adventure can’<span class=\"No-Break\">t address.</span></p><p>Published adventures also provide inspiration. You might not use an adventure as written, but it might spur ideas, or you can pull out one part of it and repurpose that part for your needs. For example, you might use a map of a temple but repopulate it with monsters of your choice, or you might use a chase sequence as a model for a pursuit scene in your<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><h2>Adventure Structure</h2><p>Like every story, a typical adventure has a beginning, a middle, a<span class=\"No-Break\">nd an end.</span></p><h3>Beginning</h3><p>An adventure starts with a hook to get the players interested. A good adventure hook piques the interest of the players and provides a compelling reason for their characters to become involved in the adventure. Maybe the adventurers stumble onto something they’re not meant to see, monsters attack them on the road, an assassin makes an attempt on their lives, or a dragon shows up at the city gates. Adventure hooks such as these can instantly draw players into y<span class=\"No-Break\">our story.</span></p><p>The beginning of a good adventure should be exciting and focused. You want the players to go home looking forward to the next session, so give them a clear sense of where the story is headed, as well as something to look f<span class=\"No-Break\">orward to.</span></p><h3>Middle</h3><p>The middle of an adventure is where the bulk of the story unfolds. With each new challenge, the adventurers make important choices that have a clear effect on the conclusion of the <span class=\"No-Break\">adventure.</span></p><p>Over the course of the adventure, the characters might discover secrets that reveal new goals or change their original goal. Their understanding of what’s going on around them might change. Maybe rumors of treasure were a trick to lure them into a death trap. Perhaps the so-called spy in the queen’s court is actually a scheme concocted by the monarch herself to seize even m<span class=\"No-Break\">ore power.</span></p><p>At the same time the adventurers are working to thwart their adversaries, those adversaries are trying to carry out their nefarious plans. Such enemies might also work to hide their deeds, mislead potential adversaries, or confront problems directly, perhaps by trying to kill<span class=\"No-Break\"> meddlers.</span></p><p>Remember that the characters are the heroes of the story. Never let them become mere spectators, watching as events unfold around them that they can’t <span class=\"No-Break\">influence.</span></p><h3>Ending</h3><p>The ending encompasses the climax — the scene or encounter in which the tension building throughout the adventure reaches its peak. A strong climax should have the players on edge, with the fate of the characters and much more hanging in the balance. The outcome, which hinges on the characters’ actions and decisions, should never be a forgone c<span class=\"No-Break\">onclusion.</span></p><p>An ending needn’t tie everything up in a neat bow. Story threads can be left hanging, waiting to be resolved in a later adventure. A little bit of unfinished business is an easy way to transition from one adventure to<span class=\"No-Break\"> the next.</span></p><h2>Adventure Types</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/831/c3-02.png\"></p><p>An adventure can be location-based or event-based, as discussed in the sections th<span class=\"No-Break\">at follow.</span></p><h3>Location-Based Adventures</h3><p>Adventures set in crumbling dungeons and remote wilderness locations are the cornerstone of countless campaigns. Many of the greatest D&amp;D adventures of all time are locat<span class=\"No-Break\">ion-based.</span></p><p>Creating a location-based adventure can be broken down into a number of steps. Each step provides tables from which you can select the basic elements of your adventure. Alternatively, roll on the tables and see how the random results inspire you. You can mix up the order of <span class=\"No-Break\">the steps.</span></p><h4>1. Identify the Party’s Goals</h4><p>The Dungeon Goals table provides common goals that drive or lure adventurers into dungeons. The Wilderness Goals table provides similar inspiration for an adventure focused on outdoor exploration. The Other Goals table suggests location-based adventures that don’t fit neatly into the first two c<span class=\"No-Break\">ategories.</span></p><h5>Dungeon Goals</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1158641723\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[pqt5ex4wU25IA8TJ]{Goal}</span></div></div></div><h5>Wilderness Goals</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"977170533\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[G1y8SzFjf1GFpkdl]{Goal}</span></div></div></div><h5>Other Goals</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1836871141\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[NecT4RglP0PPy6OD]{Goal}</span></div></div></div><h4>2. Identify Important NPCs</h4><p>Use the Adventure Villains, Adventure Allies, and Adventure Patrons tables to help you identify these NPCs. <a title=\"Creating Nonplayer Characters\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters\">Chapter 4</a>&nbsp;can help you bring these NPC<span class=\"No-Break\">s to life.</span></p><h5>Adventure Villains</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1922993817\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[Tq6UYmok8eub6mLp]{Villain}</span></div></div></div><h5>Adventure Allies</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"503185905\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[hYnLYAU3xbyrYqzO]{Ally}</span></div></div></div><h5>Adventure Patrons</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-2143720682\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[tsCGw3a5L7178Vz7]{Patron}</span></div></div></div><h4>3. Flesh Out the Location Details</h4><p><a title=\"Adventure Environments\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/adventure-environments\">Chapter 5</a>&nbsp;offers suggestions for creating and fleshing out an adventure location, including tables that can help you establish the important elements of a dungeon, wilderness area, or urba<span class=\"No-Break\">n setting.</span></p><h4>4. Find the Ideal Introduction</h4><p>An adventure can begin with a social interaction encounter in which the adventurers find out what they must do and why. It can start with a surprise attack, or with the adventurers coming across information by accident. The best introductions arise naturally from the goals and setting of the adventure. Let the entries in the Adventure Introduction table in<span class=\"No-Break\">spire you.</span></p><h5>Adventure Introduction</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"215179117\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[fXOTHtyTn8VdQmMB]{Introduction}</span></div></div></div><h4>5. Consider the Ideal Climax</h4><p>The climactic ending of an adventure fulfills the promise of all that came before. Although the climax must hinge on the successes and failures of the characters up to that moment, the Adventure Climax table can provide suggestions to help you shape the end of your <span class=\"No-Break\">adventure.</span></p><h5>Adventure Climax</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-2019429117\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[oLHR07evgUmiZbuO]{Climax}</span></div></div></div><h4>6. Plan Encounters</h4><p>After you’ve created the location and the overall story of the adventure, it’s time to plan out the encounters that make up that adventure. In a location-based adventure, most encounters are keyed to specific locations on a map. For each room or wilderness area on the adventure map, your key describes what’s in that area: its physical features, as well as any encounter that plays out there. The adventure key turns a simple sketch of numbered areas on graph paper into encounters designed to entertain and intrigue you<span class=\"No-Break\">r players.</span></p><p>See “<a title=\"Creating Encounters\" href=\"#CreatingEncounters\">Creating Encounters</a>” later in this chapter for guidance on crafting individual e<span class=\"No-Break\">ncounters.</span></p><h3>Event-Based Adventures</h3><p>In an event-based adventure, the focus is on what the characters and villains do and what happens as a result. The question of where those things happen is of secondary i<span class=\"No-Break\">mportance.</span></p><p>Building an event-based adventure is more work than building a location-based one, but the process can be simplified by following a number of straightforward steps. Several steps include tables from which you can choose adventure elements or roll randomly for inspiration. As with location-based adventures, you don’t necessarily have to follow these steps<span class=\"No-Break\"> in order.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/832/c3-03.png\"></p><h4>1. Start with a Villain</h4><p>Putting care into creating your villain will pay off later, since the villain plays such a pivotal role in advancing the story. Use the Adventure Villains table in the previous section to get started, and use the information in <a title=\"Creating Nonplayer Characters\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters\">chapter 4</a>&nbsp;to help flesh out th<span class=\"No-Break\">e villain.</span></p><p>For example, your villain might be an undead creature seeking to avenge a past imprisonment or injury. An interesting aspect of an undead villain is that this past injury might have occurred centuries ago, inspiring revenge against the descendants of those that harmed it. Imagine a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"vampire\">vampire</a> imprisoned by the members of a religious order of knights, and who now seeks revenge against the current members of t<span class=\"No-Break\">hat order.</span></p><h4>2. Determine the Villain’s Actions</h4><p>Once you have a villain, it’s time to determine what steps the villain takes to achieve its goals. Create a timeline showing what the villain does and when, assuming no interference from the ad<span class=\"No-Break\">venturers.</span></p><p>Building on the previous example, you might decide that your <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"vampire\">vampire</a> villain murders several knights. By slipping past locked doors in gaseous form, the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"vampire\">vampire</a> is able to make the deaths appear natural at first, but it soon becomes clear that a depraved killer is behind th<span class=\"No-Break\">e murders.</span></p><p>If you need additional inspiration, consider a few different options for how the villain’s actions unfold over the course of the <span class=\"No-Break\">adventure.</span></p><h5>Event-Based Villain Actions</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"466804584\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[DMRTyz2tWDxgU5bj]{Type of Actions}</span></div></div></div><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Big Event. </span></strong>The villain’s plans come to fruition during a festival, an astrological event, a holy (or unholy) rite, a royal wedding, the birth of a child, or some similar fixed time. The villain’s activities up to that point are geared toward preparation for t<span class=\"No-Break\">his event.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Crime Spree. </span></strong>The villain commits acts that become bolder and more heinous over time. A killer might start out by targeting the destitute in the city slums before moving up to a massacre in the marketplace, increasing the horror and the body count <span class=\"No-Break\">each time.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Growing Corruption. </span></strong>As time passes, the villain’s power and influence grow, affecting more victims across a larger area. This might take the form of armies conquering new territory, an evil cult recruiting new members, or a spreading plague. A pretender to the throne might attempt to secure the support of the kingdom’s nobility in the days or weeks leading up to a coup, or a guild leader could corrupt the members of a town council or bribe officers of <span class=\"No-Break\">the watch.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">One and Done.</span></strong> The villain commits a single crime and then tries to avoid the consequences. Instead of an ongoing plan to commit more crimes, the villain’s goal is to lie low or flee <span class=\"No-Break\">the scene.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Serial Crimes. </span></strong>The villain commits crimes one after the other, but these acts are repetitive in nature, rather than escalating to greater heights of depravity. The trick to catching such a villain lies in determining the pattern underlying the crimes. Though serial killers are a common example of this type of villain, your villain could be a serial arsonist favoring a certain type of building, a magical sickness that affects spellcasters who cast a specific spell, a thief that targets a certain kind of merchant, or a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/doppelganger\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"doppelganger\">doppelganger</a> kidnapping and impersonating one noble afte<span class=\"No-Break\">r another.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Step by Step.</span></strong> In pursuit of its goal, the villain carries out a specific set of actions in a particular sequence. A wizard might steal the items needed to create a phylactery and become a lich, or a cultist might kidnap the priests of seven good-aligned gods as a sacrifice. Alternatively, the villain could be following a trail to find the object of its revenge, killing one victim after another while moving ever closer to the re<span class=\"No-Break\">al target.</span></p><h4>3. Determine the Party’s Goals</h4><p>You can use the Event-Based Goals table to set the party’s goal. A goal can also suggest ways in which the adventurers become caught up in the villain’s plans, and what exactly they must do to foil th<span class=\"No-Break\">ose plans.</span></p><h5>Event-Based Goals</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"595715248\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[BVa9pgto9Ooh0qag]{Goal}</span></div></div></div><p>For example, you roll a 10 on the table, indicating that the party’s goal is to secure aid from a ruler or council. You decide to connect that to the leadership of the order targeted by your <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"vampire\">vampire</a> villain. Maybe the order’s leaders have a chest of jewels stolen from the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"vampire\">vampire</a> centuries ago, and the characters can use the chest as bait to trap th<span class=\"No-Break\">e villain.</span></p><h4>4. Identify Important NPCs</h4><p>Many event-based adventures require a well-detailed cast of NPCs. Some of these NPCs fall neatly into the categories of allies and patrons, but most are likely to be characters or creatures whose attitudes toward the adventurers remain undecided until the adventurers interact with them. (See <a title=\"Creating Nonplayer Characters\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters\">chapter 4</a>&nbsp;for more information on creat<span class=\"No-Break\">ing NPCs.)</span></p><p>The elements of the adventure you’ve determined so far should provide a clear idea of what supporting characters you need to create, as well as how much detail you need to generate for each one. NPCs unlikely to become involved in combat don’t need full combat statistics, for example, just as characters heavily involved in negotiation could have ideals, bonds, and flaws. If it’s helpful, roll on the Adventure Allies or Adventure Patrons tables (in the “<a title=\"Location-Based Adventures\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-adventures#LocationBasedAdventures\">Location-Based Adventures</a>” section, earlier in this<span class=\"No-Break\">&nbsp;chapter).</span></p><h4>5. Anticipate the Villain’s Reactions</h4><p>As the adventurers pursue their goals and foil the villain’s plans, how does the villain respond? Does it lash out in violence or send dire warnings? Does it look for simple solutions to its problems or create more complicated schemes to route around int<span class=\"No-Break\">erference?</span></p><p>Look over the villain’s actions that you outlined in step 2. For each event arising from those actions, think about how the adventurers are likely to react. If they can prevent an action or hamper its success, what effect does that have on the villain’s overall plan? What can the villain do to c<span class=\"No-Break\">ompensate?</span></p><p>One way to track a villain’s reactions is by using a flowchart. This might grow out of the timeline that describes the villain’s plans, outlining how the villain gets back on track after the adventurers thwart its plans. Or the flowchart could be separate from the timeline, showing the various actions the adventurers might take and the villain’s response to thos<span class=\"No-Break\">e actions.</span></p><h4>6. Detail Key Locations</h4><p>Since locations aren’t the focus of the adventure, they can be simpler and smaller than a dungeon complex or an expanse of wilderness. They might be specific locations in a city, or even individual rooms in locations where combat is likely to break out or significant exploration is needed, such as a throne room, a guild headquarters, a vampire’s crumbling manor, or a knights’ chap<span class=\"No-Break\">ter house.</span></p><h4>7. Choose an Introduction and a Climax</h4><p>The Adventure Introduction table in the “Location-Based Adventures” section offers fun possibilities for hooking the characters into the events of your adventure, including dreams, hauntings, and a simple plea for help. The Adventure Climax table in that same section includes adventure endings that work just as well for event-based a<span class=\"No-Break\">dventures.</span></p><p>For example, the Adventure Introduction table helps you decide that an ally the adventurers care about needs their help. Perhaps the NPC is a knight who believes that a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"vampire\">vampire</a> is trying to kill him, or a friend or relative hoping to find the knight’s murderer. This NPC brings the vampire’s crimes to the characters’ <span class=\"No-Break\">attention.</span></p><p>Looking over the Adventure Climax table, you might decide to have the adventurers bait the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"vampire\">vampire</a> with a chest of jewels stolen from its lair. As an added twist, you decide that the vampire’s true goal is to retrieve a necklace among the jewels. The necklace is set with nine gems, and with these gems the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"vampire\">vampire</a> can open a gate to the Nine Hells. Should the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"vampire\">vampire</a> succeed, the adventurers will have a more pressing threat to deal with, as a powerful devil steps through the gate and honors some ancient pact it made with th<span class=\"No-Break\">e <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"vampire\">vampire</a>.</span></p><h4>8. Plan Encounters</h4><p>After you’ve created the overall story of the adventure, it’s time to plan out the encounters on which the events of that adventure will hang. In an event-based adventure, encounters occur when the villain’s agenda intersects the path of the characters. You can’t always anticipate exactly when or where that will happen, but you can create a list of possible encounters that the adventurers might experience. This can take the form of general descriptions of the villain’s forces, details of its lieutenants and minions, as well as encounters tied to the key locations of the <span class=\"No-Break\">adventure.</span></p><p>See “<a title=\"Creating Encounters\" href=\"#CreatingEncounters\">Creating Encounters</a>” later in this chapter for guidance on crafting individual e<span class=\"No-Break\">ncounters.</span></p><h3>Mysteries</h3><p>A mystery is a form of event-based adventure that usually focuses on the adventurers’ efforts to solve a crime, usually a robbery or murder. Unlike the writer of a mystery novel, a Dungeon Master can’t always predict what the characters will do in a mystery <span class=\"No-Break\">adventure.</span></p><p>A villain whose actions are “crime spree,” “one and done,” or “serial crimes” might inspire you to craft a mystery adventure around that villain’s crimes. Similarly, if the adventurers’ goals include determining the villain’s identity, that might be part of <span class=\"No-Break\">a mystery.</span></p><p>To build a mystery adventure, follow the steps for creating any event-based adventure. Then consider three additional elements for the adventure: the victim, the suspects, and <span class=\"No-Break\">the clues.</span></p><h4>Victim</h4><p>Think about the victim’s relationship to the villain. Though you can create a strong scenario with no such relationship, part of what makes a mystery exciting is the discovery of the twisted connections between NPCs and how those connections led to the crime. A random killing might be just as mysterious, but it lacks that emotional c<span class=\"No-Break\">onnection.</span></p><p>Also look for a connection between the victim and one or more of the adventurers. One surefire way to draw adventurers into a mystery — including making them suspects — is to make the victim someone with whom the characters are a<span class=\"No-Break\">cquainted.</span></p><h4>Suspects</h4><p>Your cast of characters should include an assortment of other NPCs who didn’t commit the crime, but who had the motive, the means, or the opportunity to do so. Suspects might be obvious or could come to light during the investigation. One technique often used in detective fiction is to create a closed circle of suspects — a finite number of individuals whose circumstances make them the only possible<span class=\"No-Break\"> suspects.</span></p><p>One tip for keeping the players and the adventurers guessing as to the identity of the villain is to ensure that more than one suspect has a secret. When questioned by the adventurers, a suspect might appear nervous or attempt to lie, despite being innocent of the crime. A secret business deal, an illicit affair, a dark past, or an uncontrolled vice are flaws that make suspects more interesting than NPCs with nothin<span class=\"No-Break\">g to hide.</span></p><h4>Clues</h4><p>Clues point to the identity of the villain. Some clues are verbal, including the statements of the suspects and witnesses that help the adventurers develop a picture of what happened. Other clues are physical, such as an unfinished message written in the victim’s blood, a piece of jewelry left behind by the villain, or a weapon found hidden in a suspe<span class=\"No-Break\">ct’s room.</span></p><p>A clue should connect a suspect to the crime, typically by shedding light on the suspect’s motive, means, or opportunity. Some clues connect the wrong suspect to the crime, leading the adventurers in the wrong direction. Eventually, they must find other clues pointing in a different direction, or come across evidence that absolves th<span class=\"No-Break\">e suspect.</span></p><p>It’s better to populate your adventure with too many clues than too few. If the adventurers solve the mystery too quickly, you might feel some disappointment but the players will feel a sense of accomplishment. If the mystery is too hard, though, the players will become frustrated. Since you have to account for the possibility that the adventurers will overlook some clues, use redundant clues to ensure that the players have the knowledge needed to catch th<span class=\"No-Break\">e villain.</span></p><h3>Intrigue</h3><p>Intrigue adventures are event-based adventures that revolve around power struggles. Intrigues are common in the courts of the nobility, but power struggles can play out just as easily in merchants’ guilds, crime syndicates, and temple hi<span class=\"No-Break\">erarchies.</span></p><p>Rather than dark events and villainous plots, an intrigue adventure typically revolves around the exchange of favors, the rise and fall of individuals in power and influence, and the honeyed words of diplomacy. A prince’s efforts to be named heir to the throne, a courtier’s ambition to sit at the queen’s right hand, and a merchant’s desire to open a trade route through enemy lands are the stuff of<span class=\"No-Break\"> intrigue.</span></p><p>Like all adventures, an intrigue adventure works only if the players and their characters are invested in the outcome. If no one cares who the king’s chamberlain is or who has logging rights in the elven woods, throwing the characters into an adventure centered on those issues will fall flat. However, if having the ear of the king’s chamberlain means the characters can use royal soldiers to help them defend their own stronghold on the borderlands, players will be invested in the<span class=\"No-Break\"> scenario.</span></p><p>Adventurers usually become embroiled in intrigue when they need a favor from a powerful creature and have to perform a favor in exchange, or when the plots of powerful NPCs get in the way of the characters achieving their goals. Some of the event-based goals discussed earlier in this section lend themselves to intrigue adventures. For example, if the adventurers must uncover a conspiracy, negotiate a peace treaty, or secure aid from a ruler or council, you might be looking at an intrigue <span class=\"No-Break\">adventure.</span></p><p>The process of creating an intrigue adventure is similar to creating any other event-based adventure, with two main differences: how villains are handled and how the characters can gain <span class=\"No-Break\">influence.</span></p><h4>Villains</h4><p>Some intrigue adventures are driven by the actions of a single villain, such as a noble plotting the assassination of a monarch. However, an intrigue adventure can have multiple villains or no villa<span class=\"No-Break\">in at all.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">No Villain.</span></strong> Some intrigue adventures revolve around the exchange of favors in the absence of a villain. For this type of adventure, skip steps 1 and 2 of the event-based adventure creation process (the villain and the villain’s actions) and move straight to the adventurers’ goals in step 3. Figure out why the adventurers become involved in the intrigue, then spend the bulk of your time creating the NPCs they inte<span class=\"No-Break\">ract with.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Many Villains.</span></strong> Some intrigue adventures feature a whole cast of villains, each with its own goals, motivations, and methods. The adventurers might be drawn into the struggle of a court full of nobles vying for the throne in the wake of the king’s sudden death, or could find themselves negotiating the end to a deadly turf war among thieves’ guilds. In this scenario, you’ll spend a lot of time on steps 1 and 2, developing each of the major NPCs as a distinct villain with <span class=\"No-Break\">an agenda.</span></p><p>In step 5, you’ll need to develop each villain’s reactions to the potential setbacks they face during the adventure. However, you don’t need to put equal effort into detailing the reactions of every villain, since many will likely echo each other or cancel each other out. Whenever the adventurers foil one villain’s plans, it might let another villain’s schemes move forward, advancing the adventure whether the foiled villain reac<span class=\"No-Break\">ts or not.</span></p><h4>Influence</h4><p>Depending on the scenario, you might want to track the party’s influence with different NPCs or factions, or even track influence separately for each <span class=\"No-Break\">character.</span></p><p>One way to handle influence is to treat it like inspiration. A character gains influence in a certain situation only if you grant it, and bringing influence into play requires spending it. Characters can gain influence by doing favors for NPCs, advancing the cause of an organization, or demonstrating their power and heroism, at your discretion. As with inspiration, a character can choose to spend influence to gain advantage on a roll relevant to that <span class=\"No-Break\">influence.</span></p><p>Another way to handle influence is to treat it like renown (see <a title=\"Renown\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/a-world-of-your-own#Renown\">chapter 1</a>), allowing characters to gain renown at court and within various key<span class=\"No-Break\"> factions.</span></p><h3>Framing Events</h3><p>You can base an entire adventure on a framing event or use such an event to grab the players’ interest. The Framing Events table presents several ideas, or you can use it to inspire your own fram<span class=\"No-Break\">ing event.</span></p><h5>Framing Events</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1128161484\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[KTw3FNac8rxFZAuO]{Event}</span></div></div></div><h2>Complications</h2><p>Sometimes an adventure isn’t as straightforward as it m<span class=\"No-Break\">ight seem.</span></p><h3>Moral Quandaries</h3><p>If you want to give the characters a crisis that no amount of spellcasting or swordplay can resolve, add a moral quandary to the adventure. A moral quandary is a problem of conscience for which the adventurers must make a single choice — but never a s<span class=\"No-Break\">imple one.</span></p><h5>Moral Quandaries</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-665945495\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[NLKwngFRsZAJrPjZ]{Quandary}</span></div></div></div><p><span class=\"italic\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/833/c3-04.png\"></span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Ally Quandary.</span></strong> The adventurers have a better chance of achieving their goal with the help of two individuals whose expertise is all but essential. However, these two NPCs hate each other and refuse to work together even if the fate of the world hangs in the balance. The adventurers must choose the NPC that is most likely to help them accomplish t<span class=\"No-Break\">heir goal.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Friend Quandary.</span></strong> An NPC that one or more of the characters cares about makes an impossible demand on the characters. A love interest might demand that a character turn away from a dangerous quest. A dear friend might plead with the characters to spare the villain’s life, to prove that they are better than the villain. A weak NPC might beg for a chance to win favor from the characters by undertaking a dangerous but essentia<span class=\"No-Break\">l mission.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Honor Quandary.</span></strong> A character is forced to choose between victory and a personal oath or code of honor. A paladin who has sworn an oath of virtue might realize that the clearest path to success lies in deceit and subterfuge. A loyal cleric might be tempted to disobey the orders of his or her faith. If you present this quandary, be sure to provide an opportunity for a character to atone for violating his or<span class=\"No-Break\"> her oath.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Rescue Quandary.</span></strong> The adventurers must choose between catching or hurting the villain and saving innocent lives. For example, the adventurers might learn that the villain is camped nearby, but they also learn that another part of the villain’s forces is about to march into a village and burn it to the ground. The characters must choose between taking out the villain or protecting innocent villagers, some of whom might be friends or famil<span class=\"No-Break\">y members.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Respect Quandary.</span></strong> Two important allies give conflicting directions or advice to the adventurers. Perhaps the high priest counsels the characters to negotiate peace with militaristic elves in the nearby forest, while a veteran warrior urges them to prove their strength with a decisive first strike. The adventurers can’t follow both courses, and whichever ally they choose, the other loses respect for them and might no longer<span class=\"No-Break\"> aid them.</span></p><h3>Twists</h3><p>A twist can complicate a story and make it harder for the characters to complete th<span class=\"No-Break\">eir goals.</span></p><h5>Twists</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-712106209\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[CWpNNSnKnoEQTbYA]{Twist}</span></div></div></div><h3>Side Quests</h3><p>You can also add one or more side quests to your adventure, taking the characters off the main story path defined by location or events. Side quests are peripheral to the characters’ primary goal, but successfully completing a side quest might provide a benefit toward completing the pri<span class=\"No-Break\">mary goal.</span></p><h5>Side Quests</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-128597021\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[WPx07dd09YT8UCxH]{Side Quest}</span></div></div></div><h2>Creating Encounters</h2><p>Encounters are the individual scenes in the larger story of your <span class=\"No-Break\">adventure.</span></p><p>First and foremost, an encounter should be fun for the players. Second, it shouldn’t be burden for you to run. Beyond that, a well-crafted encounter usually has a straightforward objective as well as some connection to the overarching story of your campaign, building on the encounters that precede it while foreshadowing encounters ye<span class=\"No-Break\">t to come.</span></p><p>An encounter has one of three possible outcomes: the characters succeed, the characters partly succeed, or the characters fail. The encounter needs to account for all three possibilities, and the outcome needs to have consequences so that the players feel like their successes and failur<span class=\"No-Break\">es matter.</span></p><h3>Character Objectives</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/834/c3-05.png\"></p><p>When players don’t know what they’re supposed to do in a given encounter, anticipation and excitement can quickly turn to boredom and frustration. A transparent objective alleviates the risk of players losing<span class=\"No-Break\"> interest.</span></p><p>For example, if the overall story of your adventure involves a quest to deliver a priceless relic to a remote monastery, each encounter along the way is an opportunity to introduce a smaller objective that moves the quest forward. Encounters during the trip might see the adventurers accosted by enemies determined to steal the relic, or by monsters that are constantly threatening the <span class=\"No-Break\">monastery.</span></p><p>Some players create their own objectives, which is to be expected and encouraged. It is, after all, as much the players’ campaign as yours. For example, a character might try to bribe enemies rather than fight them, or chase after a fleeing enemy to see where it goes. Players who ignore objectives will have to deal with the consequences, which is another important facet of encount<span class=\"No-Break\">er design.</span></p><h4>Sample Objectives</h4><p>The following objectives can be used as foundations for encounters. Although these objectives focus on a single encounter during an adventure, using the same objective in multiple encounters allows you to combine those encounters into a larger obstacle or problem the adventurers must<span class=\"No-Break\"> overcome.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Make Peace.</span></strong> The characters must convince two opposing groups (or their leaders) to end the conflict that embroils them. As a complication, the characters might have enemies on one or both of the opposing sides, or some other group or individual might be instigating the conflict to further its<span class=\"No-Break\"> own ends.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Protect an NPC or Object.</span></strong> The characters must act as bodyguards or protect some object in their custody. As a complication, the NPC under the party’s protection might be cursed, diseased, prone to panic attacks, too young or too old to fight, or apt to risk the lives of the adventurers through dubious decisions. The object the adventurers have sworn to protect might be sentient, cursed, or difficult to <span class=\"No-Break\">transport.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Retrieve an Object.</span></strong> The adventurers must gain possession of a specific object in the area of the encounter, preferably before combat finishes. As a complication, enemies might desire the object as much as the adventurers do, forcing both parties to fig<span class=\"No-Break\">ht for it.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Run a Gauntlet.</span></strong> The adventurers must pass through a dangerous area. This objective is similar to retrieving an object insofar as reaching the exit is a higher priority than killing opponents in the area. A time limit adds a complication, as does a decision point that might lead characters astray. Other complications include traps, hazards, and<span class=\"No-Break\"> monsters.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Sneak In. </span></strong>The adventurers need to move through the encounter area without making their enemies aware of their presence. Complications might ensue if they are<span class=\"No-Break\"> detected.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Stop a Ritual. </span></strong>The plots of evil cult leaders, malevolent warlocks, and powerful fiends often involve rituals that must be foiled. Characters engaged in stopping a ritual must typically fight their way through evil minions before attempting to disrupt the ritual’s powerful magic. As a complication, the ritual might be close to completion when the characters arrive, imposing a time limit. Depending on the ritual, its completion might have immediate consequence<span class=\"No-Break\">s as well.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Take Out a Single Target. </span></strong>The villain is surrounded by minions powerful enough to kill the adventurers. The characters can flee and hope to confront the villain another day, or they can try to fight their way through the minions to take out their target. As a complication, the minions might be innocent creatures under the villain’s control. Killing the villain means breaking that control, but the adventurers must endure the minions’ attacks unti<span class=\"No-Break\">l they do.</span></p><h3>Creating a Combat Encounter</h3><p>When creating a combat encounter, let your imagination run wild and build something your players will enjoy. Once you have the details figured out, use this section to adjust the difficulty of the <span class=\"No-Break\">encounter.</span></p><h4>Combat Encounter Difficulty</h4><p>There are four categories of encounter d<span class=\"No-Break\">ifficulty.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Easy. </span></strong>An easy encounter doesn’t tax the characters’ resources or put them in serious peril. They might lose a few hit points, but victory is pretty much g<span class=\"No-Break\">uaranteed.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Medium.</span></strong> A medium encounter usually has one or two scary moments for the players, but the characters should emerge victorious with no casualties. One or more of them might need to use healing <span class=\"No-Break\">resources.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Hard.</span></strong> A hard encounter could go badly for the adventurers. Weaker characters might get taken out of the fight, and there’s a slim chance that one or more characters <span class=\"No-Break\">might die.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Deadly.</span></strong> A deadly encounter could be lethal for one or more player characters. Survival often requires good tactics and quick thinking, and the party ris<span class=\"No-Break\">ks defeat.</span></p><h5>XP Thresholds by Character Level</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"2010130969\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[PSOgSovYonRE88NW]{Character Level: Encounter Difficulty, Easy}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"2010130970\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[NDjUiaGDtJoTHyB0]{Character Level: Encounter Difficulty, Medium}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"2010130971\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[X4Yj9kfdOqsWsF1h]{Character Level: Encounter Difficulty, Hard}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"2010130972\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[X7rNEFGnOFckjyCo]{Character Level: Encounter Difficulty, Deadly}</span></div></div></div><blockquote>\n<p><strong>CHALLENGE RATING</strong></p>\n<p>When putting together an encounter or adventure, especially at lower levels, exercise caution when using monsters whose challenge rating is higher than the party’s average level. Such a creature might deal enough damage with a single action to take out adventurers of a lower level. For example, an ogre has a challenge rating of 2, but it can kill a 1st-level wizard with a si<span class=\"No-Break\">ngle blow.</span></p>\n<p>In addition, some monsters have features that might be difficult or impossible for lower-level characters to overcome. For example, a rakshasa has a challenge rating of 13 and is immune to spells of 6th level and lower. Spellcasters of 12th level or lower have no spells higher than 6th level, meaning that they won’t be able to affect the rakshasa with their magic, putting the adventurers at a serious disadvantage. Such an encounter would be significantly tougher for the party than the monster’s challenge rating migh<span class=\"No-Break\">t suggest.</span></p>\n</blockquote><h4>Evaluating Encounter Difficulty</h4><p>Use the following method to gauge the difficulty of any combat <span class=\"No-Break\">encounter.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">1. Determine XP Thresholds. </span></strong>First, determine the experience point (XP) thresholds for each character in the party. The XP Thresholds by Character Level table below has four XP thresholds for each character level, one for each category of encounter difficulty. Use a character’s level to determine his or her XP thresholds. Repeat this process for every character in <span class=\"No-Break\">the party.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">2. Determine the Party’s XP Threshold.</span></strong> For each category of encounter difficulty, add up the characters’ XP thresholds. This determines the party’s XP threshold. You’ll end up with four totals, one for each category of encounter d<span class=\"No-Break\">ifficulty.</span></p><p>For example, if your party includes three 3rd-level characters and one 2nd-level character, the party’s totaled XP thresholds would be a<span class=\"No-Break\">s follows:</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Easy:</span></strong> 275 XP (75 + 75 <span class=\"No-Break\">+ 75 + 50)</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Medium:</span></strong> 550 XP (150 + 150 + <span class=\"No-Break\">150 + 100)</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Hard:</span></strong> 825 XP (225 + 225 + <span class=\"No-Break\">225 + 150)</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Deadly:</span></strong> 1,400 XP (400 + 400 + <span class=\"No-Break\">400 + 200)</span></p><p>Record the totals, because you can use them for every encounter in your <span class=\"No-Break\">adventure.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">3. Total the Monsters’ XP.</span></strong> Add up the XP for all of the monsters in the encounter. Every monster has an XP value in its s<span class=\"No-Break\">tat block.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">4. Modify Total XP for Multiple Monsters.</span></strong> If the encounter includes more than one monster, apply a multiplier to the monsters’ total XP. The more monsters there are, the more attack rolls you’re making against the characters in a given round, and the more dangerous the encounter becomes. To correctly gauge an encounter’s difficulty, multiply the total XP of all the monsters in the encounter by the value given in the Encounter Multipli<span class=\"No-Break\">ers table.</span></p><p>For example, if an encounter includes four monsters worth a total of 500 XP, you would multiply the total XP of the monsters by 2, for an adjusted value of 1,000 XP. This adjusted value is <span class=\"italic\">not</span> what the monsters are worth in terms of XP; the adjusted value’s only purpose is to help you accurately assess the encounter’s d<span class=\"No-Break\">ifficulty.</span></p><p>When making this calculation, don’t count any monsters whose challenge rating is significantly below the average challenge rating of the other monsters in the group unless you think the weak monsters significantly contribute to the difficulty of the <span class=\"No-Break\">encounter.</span></p><h5>Encounter Multipliers</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-2111379860\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[KRVZS5jUMIXrx1EV]{Multiplier}</span></div></div></div><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">5. Compare XP.</span></strong> Compare the monsters’ adjusted XP value to the party’s XP thresholds. The threshold that equals the adjusted XP value determines the encounter’s difficulty. If there’s no match, use the closest threshold that is lower than the adjusted XP value.</p><p>For example, an encounter with one bugbear and three hobgoblins has an adjusted XP value of 1,000, making it a hard encounter for a party of three 3rd-level characters and one 2nd-level character (which has a hard encounter threshold of 825 XP and a deadly encounter threshold of <span class=\"No-Break\">1,400 XP).</span></p><h4>Party Size</h4><p>The preceding guidelines assume that you have a party consisting of three to five ad<span class=\"No-Break\">venturers.</span></p><p>If the party contains fewer than three characters, apply the next highest multiplier on the Encounter Multipliers table. For example, apply a multiplier of 1.5 when the characters fight a single monster, and a multiplier of 5 for groups of fifteen or more<span class=\"No-Break\"> monsters.</span></p><p>If the party contains six or more characters, use the next lowest multiplier on the table. Use a multiplier of 0.5 for a singl<span class=\"No-Break\">e monster.</span></p><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/835/c3-06.png\"></span></p><h4>Multipart Encounters</h4><p>Sometimes an encounter features multiple enemies that the party doesn’t face all at once. For example, monsters might come at the party in waves. For such encounters, treat each discrete part or wave as a separate encounter for the purpose of determining its d<span class=\"No-Break\">ifficulty.</span></p><p>A party can’t benefit from a short rest between parts of a multipart encounter, so they won’t be able to spend Hit Dice to regain hit points or recover any abilities that require a short rest to regain. As a rule, if the adjusted XP value for the monsters in a multipart encounter is higher than one-third of the party’s expected XP total for the adventuring day (see “The Adventuring Day,” below), the encounter is going to be tougher than the sum of <span class=\"No-Break\">its parts.</span></p><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/836/c3-07.png\"></span></p><h4>Building Encounters on a Budget</h4><p>You can build an encounter if you know its desired difficulty. The party’s XP thresholds give you an XP budget that you can spend on monsters to build easy, medium, hard, and deadly encounters. Just remember that groups of monsters eat up more of that budget than their base XP values would indicate (se<span class=\"No-Break\">e step 4).</span></p><p>For example, using the party from step 2, you can build a medium encounter by making sure that the adjusted XP value of the monsters is at least 550 XP (the party’s threshold for a medium encounter) and no more than 825 XP (the party’s threshold for a hard encounter). A single monster of challenge rating 3 (such as a manticore or owlbear) is worth 700 XP, so that’s one possibility. If you want a pair of monsters, each one will count for 1.5 times its base XP value. A pair of dire wolves (worth 200 XP each) have an adjusted XP value of 600, making them a medium encounter for the part<span class=\"No-Break\">y as well.</span></p><p>To assist with this approach, the <em>Monster Manual</em>&nbsp;can be sorted to present a list of all monsters in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Monster Manual</span></em> organized by challen<span class=\"No-Break\">ge rating.</span></p><h4>The Adventuring Day</h4><p>Assuming typical adventuring conditions and average luck, most adventuring parties can handle about six to eight medium or hard encounters in a day. If the adventure has more easy encounters, the adventurers can get through more. If it has more deadly encounters, they can han<span class=\"No-Break\">dle fewer.</span></p><p>In the same way you figure out the difficulty of an encounter, you can use the XP values of monsters and other opponents in an adventure as a guideline for how far the party is likely to<span class=\"No-Break\"> progress.</span></p><p>For each character in the party, use the Adventuring Day XP table to estimate how much XP that character is expected to earn in a day. Add together the values of all party members to get a total for the party’s adventuring day. This provides a rough estimate of the adjusted XP value for encounters the party can handle before the characters will need to take a <span class=\"No-Break\">long rest.</span></p><h5>Adventuring Day XP</h5><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Adjusted XP per Day per Character</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">300</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">600</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">1,200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">1,700</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">3,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">4,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">5,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">6,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">7,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">9,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">10,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">11,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">13,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">15,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">18,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">20,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">25,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">27,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">30,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">40,000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h4>Short Rests</h4><p>In general, over the course of a full adventuring day, the party will likely need to take two short rests, about one-third and two-thirds of the way throug<span class=\"No-Break\">h the day.</span></p><h3>Modifying Encounter Difficulty</h3><p>An encounter can be made easier or harder based on the choice of location and the <span class=\"No-Break\">situation.</span></p><p>Increase the difficulty of the encounter by one step (from easy to medium, for example) if the characters have a drawback that their enemies don’t. Reduce the difficulty by one step if the characters have a benefit that their enemies don’t. Any additional benefit or drawback pushes the encounter one step in the appropriate direction. If the characters have both a benefit and a drawback, the two cancel each <span class=\"No-Break\">other out.</span></p><p>Situational drawbacks include the <span class=\"No-Break\">following:</span></p><ul>\n<li>The whole party is surprised, and the en<span class=\"No-Break\">emy isn’t.</span></li>\n<li>The enemy has cover, and the part<span class=\"No-Break\">y doesn’t.</span></li>\n<li>The characters are unable to see <span class=\"No-Break\">the enemy.</span></li>\n<li>The characters are taking damage every round from some environmental effect or magical source, and the en<span class=\"No-Break\">emy isn’t.</span></li>\n<li>The characters are hanging from a rope, in the midst of scaling a sheer wall or cliff, stuck to the floor, or otherwise in a situation that greatly hinders their mobility or makes them sitt<span class=\"No-Break\">ing ducks.</span></li>\n</ul><p>Situational benefits are similar to drawbacks except that they benefit the characters instead of <span class=\"No-Break\">the enemy.</span></p><h3>Fun Combat Encounters</h3><p>The following features can add more fun and suspense to a combat <span class=\"No-Break\">encounter:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Terrain features that pose inherent risks to both the characters and their enemies, such as a frayed rope bridge and pools of g<span class=\"No-Break\">reen slime</span></li>\n<li>Terrain features that provide a change of elevation, such as pits, stacks of empty crates, ledges, and<span class=\"No-Break\"> balconies</span></li>\n<li>Features that either inspire or force characters and their enemies to move around, such as chandeliers, kegs of gunpowder or oil, and whirling b<span class=\"No-Break\">lade traps</span></li>\n<li>Enemies in hard-to-reach locations or defensive positions, so that characters who normally attack at range are forced to move around the b<span class=\"No-Break\">attlefield</span></li>\n<li>Different types of monsters workin<span class=\"No-Break\">g together</span></li>\n</ul><h2>Random Encounters</h2><p>As characters explore a wilderness area or dungeon complex, they are bound to encounter the unexpected. Random encounters are a way to deliver the unexpected. They are usually presented in the form of a table. When a random encounter occurs, you roll a die and consult the table to determine what the party e<span class=\"No-Break\">ncounters.</span></p><p>Some players and DMs view random encounters in an adventure as time-wasters, yet well-designed random encounters can serve a variety of useful<span class=\"No-Break\"> purposes:</span></p><ul>\n<li><strong><span class=\"bold\">Create urgency. </span></strong>Adventurers don’t tend to dawdle if the threat of random encounters is hanging over their heads. Wanting to avoid wandering monsters creates a strong incentive to look for a safe place to rest. (Rolling dice behind the DM screen can often accomplish this even without an actual e<span class=\"No-Break\">ncounter.)</span></li>\n<li><strong><span class=\"bold\">Establish atmosphere.</span></strong> The appearance of thematically linked creatures as random encounters helps to create a consistent tone and atmosphere for an adventure. For example, an encounter table filled with bats, wraiths, giant spiders, and zombies creates a sense of horror, and tells the adventurers to prepare for battle with even more powerful creatures of <span class=\"No-Break\">the night.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span class=\"bold\">Drain character resources.</span></strong> Random encounters can drain the party’s hit points and spell slots, leaving the adventurers feeling underpowered and vulnerable. This creates tension, as players are forced to make decisions based on the fact that their characters aren’t at full<span class=\"No-Break\"> strength.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span class=\"bold\">Provide assistance.</span></strong> Some random encounters can benefit the characters instead of hindering or harming them. Helpful creatures or NPCs might provide the adventurers with useful information or assistance when they nee<span class=\"No-Break\">d it most.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span class=\"bold\">Add interest.</span></strong> Random encounters can reveal details about your world. They can foreshadow danger or provide hints that will help the adventurers prepare for the encounter<span class=\"No-Break\">s to come.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span class=\"bold\">Reinforce campaign themes.</span></strong> Random encounters can remind the players of the major themes of the campaign. For example, if your campaign features an ongoing war between two nations, you might design random encounter tables to reinforce the ever-present nature of the conflict. In friendly territory, your tables might include bedraggled troops returning from battle, refugees fleeing invading forces, heavily guarded caravans full of weapons, and lone messengers on horseback riding for the front lines. While characters are in hostile territory, the tables might include battlefields littered with the recently slain, armies of evil humanoids on the march, and improvised gibbets holding the bodies of deserters who tried to flee the<span class=\"No-Break\"> conflict.</span></li>\n</ul><p>Random encounters should never be tiresome to you or your players. You don’t want the players to feel as if they aren’t making progress because another random encounter brings their progress to a halt whenever they try to move forward. Likewise, you don’t want to spend time distracted by random encounters that add nothing to the adventure narrative or that interfere with the overall pace you’re tryi<span class=\"No-Break\">ng to set.</span></p><p>Not every DM likes to use random encounters. You might find that they distract from your game or are otherwise causing more trouble than you want. If random encounters don’t work for you, don’t<span class=\"No-Break\"> use them.</span></p><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/837/c3-08.png\"></span></p><h4>Triggering Random Encounters</h4><p>Because you want random encounters to build on the intended narrative of a game session, not compete with it, you should choose the placement of those encounters carefully. Think about a random encounter under any of the following circ<span class=\"No-Break\">umstances:</span></p><ul>\n<li>The players are getting off track and slowing down<span class=\"No-Break\"> the game.</span></li>\n<li>The characters stop for a short or <span class=\"No-Break\">long rest.</span></li>\n<li>The characters are undertaking a long, uneventfu<span class=\"No-Break\">l journey.</span></li>\n<li>The characters draw attention to themselves when they should be keeping a lo<span class=\"No-Break\">w profile.</span></li>\n</ul><h4>Checking for Random Encounters</h4><p>You decide when a random encounter happens, or you roll. Consider checking for a random encounter once every hour, once every 4 to 8 hours, or once during the day and once during a long rest — whatever makes the most sense based on how active th<span class=\"No-Break\">e area is.</span></p><p>If you roll, do so with a d20. If the result is 18 or higher, a random encounter occurs. You then roll on an appropriate random encounter table to determine what the adventurers meet, rerolling if the die result doesn’t make sense given the circ<span class=\"No-Break\">umstances.</span></p><p>Random encounter tables might be provided as part of the adventure you’re running, or you can use the information in this chapter to build your own. Creating your own tables is the best way to reinforce the themes and flavor of your home<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><p>Not every run-in with another creature counts as a random encounter. Encounter tables don’t usually include rabbits hopping through the undergrowth, harmless rats scurrying through dungeon halls, or average citizens walking through the streets of a city. Random encounter tables present obstacles and events that advance the plot, foreshadow important elements or themes of the adventure, and provide fun dis<span class=\"No-Break\">tractions.</span></p><h4>Creating Random Encounter Tables</h4><p>Creating your own random encounter tables is straightforward. Determine what sort of encounters might occur in a given dungeon area, figure out the likelihood of a particular encounter occurring, then arrange the results. An “encounter” in this case could be a single monster or NPC, a group of monsters or NPCs, a random event (such as an earth tremor or a parade), or a random discovery (such as a charred corpse or a message scrawled o<span class=\"No-Break\">n a wall).</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Assemble Your Encounters. </span></strong>Once you’ve established a location through which the adventurers are likely to pass, be it a wilderness area or dungeon complex, make a list of creatures that might be found wandering there. If you’re not sure which creatures to include, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/appendix-b-monster-lists\">appendix B</a> has lists of monsters organized by ter<span class=\"No-Break\">rain type.</span></p><p>For a sylvan woodland, you might create a table that includes centaurs, faerie dragons, pixies, sprites, dryads, satyrs, blink dogs, elks, owlbears, treants, giant owls, and a unicorn. If elves inhabit the forest, the table might also include elf druids and elf scouts. Perhaps gnolls are threatening the woods, so adding gnolls and hyenas to the table would be a fun surprise for players. Another fun surprise would be a wandering predator, such as a displacer beast that likes to hunt blink dogs. The table could also use a few random encounters of a less monstrous nature, such as a grove of burned trees (the handiwork of the gnolls), an ivy-covered elven statue, and a plant with glowing berries that turn creatures <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible\">invisible</a> when<span class=\"No-Break\"> ingested.</span></p><p>When choosing monsters for a random encounter table, try to imagine why the monsters would be encountered outside their lairs. What is each monster up to? Is it on patrol? Hunting for food? Searching for something? Also consider whether a creature is moving stealthily as it travels through<span class=\"No-Break\"> the area.</span></p><p>As with planned encounters, random encounters are more interesting when they happen in memorable locations. Outdoors the adventurers might be crossing a forest clearing when they encounter a unicorn or be pushing through a dense section of forest when they come across a nest of spiders. Crossing a desert, characters might discover an oasis haunted by wights or a rocky outcropping on which a blue drago<span class=\"No-Break\">n perches.</span></p><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/838/c3-09.png\"></span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Probabilities. </span></strong>A random encounter table can be created in a number of ways, ranging from simple (roll 1d6 for one of six possible encounters) to complicated (roll percentile dice, modify for time of day, and cross-index the modified number with the dungeon level). The sample encounter table presented here uses a range of 2 to 20 (nineteen entries total), generated using 1d12 + 1d8. The probability curve ensures that encounters appearing in the middle of the table are more likely to occur than encounters placed at the beginning or end of the table. A roll of 2 or 20 is rare (about a 1 percent chance of either), while each of the rolls from 9 to 13 occurs a little over 8 percent of<span class=\"No-Break\"> the time.</span></p><p>The Sylvan Forest Encounters table is an example of a random encounter table that implements the ideas mentioned above. Creature names in <span class=\"bold\">bold</span> refer to stat blocks that appear in the <em>Monster Manual</em><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><h5>Sylvan Forest Encounters</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"510356721\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[qpIrsaHMWNLRfZEJ]{Encounter}</span></div></div></div><h4>Random Encounter Challenge</h4><p>Random encounters need not be level-appropriate challenges for the adventurers, but it’s considered bad form to slaughter a party using a random encounter, since most players consider this ending to be an unsatis<span class=\"No-Break\">fying one.</span></p><p>Not all random encounters with monsters need to be resolved through combat. A 1st-level party of adventurers could have a random encounter with a young dragon circling above a forest canopy in search of a quick meal, but the characters should have the option to hide or bargain for their lives if the dragon spots them. Similarly, the party might encounter a stone giant roaming the hills, but it might have no intention of harming anyone. In fact, it might shy away from the party because of its reclusive nature. The giant might attack only characters who<span class=\"No-Break\"> annoy it.</span></p><p>That said, a random encounter table usually includes hostile (though not necessarily evil) monsters that are meant to be fought. The following monsters are considered appropriate combat c<span class=\"No-Break\">hallenges:</span></p><ul>\n<li>A single monster with a challenge rating equal to or lower than the part<span class=\"No-Break\">y’s level.</span></li>\n<li>A group of monsters whose adjusted XP value constitutes an easy, medium, or hard challenge for the party, as determined using the encounter-building guidelines earlier in thi<span class=\"No-Break\">s chapter.</span></li>\n</ul>","img":null,"_id":"rfC53Q6nD0BIK47P"}

NPCs can be enemies or allies, regular folk or named monsters. They include the local innkeeper, the old wizard who lives in the tower on the outskirts of town, the death knight out to destroy the kingdom, and the dragon counting gold in its caver<span class=\"No-Break\">nous lair.</span></p><p>This chapter shows you how to flesh out nonplayer characters for your game. For guidelines on generating monster-like stat blocks for an NPC, see chapter 9, \"<a title=\"Dungeon Master's Workshop\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop\">Dungeon Master’s </a><span class=\"No-Break\"><a title=\"Dungeon Master's Workshop\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop\">Workshop</a>.\"</span></p><h2>Designing NPCs</h2><p>Nothing brings your adventures and campaigns to life better than a cast of well-developed NPCs. That said, NPCs in your game rarely need as much complexity as a well-crafted character in a novel or movie. Most NPCs are bit players in the campaign, whereas the adventurers are <span class=\"No-Break\">the stars.</span></p><h3>Quick NPCs</h3><p>An NPC doesn’t need combat statistics unless it poses a threat. Moreover, most NPCs need only one or two qualities to make them memorable. For example, your players will have no trouble remembering the no-nonsense blacksmith with the tattoo of the black rose on his right shoulder or the badly dressed bard with the br<span class=\"No-Break\">oken nose.</span></p><h3>Detailed NPCs</h3><p>For NPCs who play larger roles in your adventures, allow more time to flesh out their histories and personalities. As you’ll see, ten sentences can sum up the main elements of a memorable NPC, one sentence for each of the <span class=\"No-Break\">following:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Occupation a<span class=\"No-Break\">nd history</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"No-Break\">Appearance</span></li>\n<li>Abilities</li>\n<li>Talent</li>\n<li>Mannerism</li>\n<li>Interactions w<span class=\"No-Break\">ith others</span></li>\n<li>Useful<span class=\"No-Break\"> knowledge</span></li>\n<li>Ideal</li>\n<li>Bond</li>\n<li>Flaw<span class=\"No-Break\"> or secret</span></li>\n</ul><p>Although the material here focuses on humanoid NPCs, you can adjust details to create monstrous NPC<span class=\"No-Break\">s as well.</span></p><h4>Occupation and History</h4><p>In one sentence, describe the NPC’s occupation and provide a brief historical note that hints at the character’s past. For example, the NPC might have served in an army, been imprisoned for a crime, or adventured <span class=\"No-Break\">years ago.</span></p><h4>Appearance</h4><p>In one sentence, describe the NPC’s most distinctive physical features. You can roll on the NPC Appearance table or choose a feature that suits the <span class=\"No-Break\">character.</span></p><h5>NPC Appearance</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1162458113\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[qk9twpTfeKlqXha3]{Feature}</span></div></div></div><h4>Abilities</h4><p>You don’t need to roll ability scores for the NPC, but note abilities that are above or below average — great strength or monumental stupidity, for example — and use them to inform the NPC’s <span class=\"No-Break\">qualities.</span></p><h5>NPC Abilities</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1057727563\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[UuzH343Qi6dEc31I]{High Ability}</span></div></div></div><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1057727562\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[mnI7ngakG2akcOl7]{Low Ability}</span></div></div></div><h4>Talent</h4><p>In one sentence, describe something that your NPC can do that is special, if anything.

An NPC’s behavior can change depending on who he or she is interacting with. For example, an innkeeper might be friendly toward guests and rude to <span class=\"No-Break\">her staff.</span></p><h5>NPC Interaction Traits</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1723766822\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[APffNKWiraLyraqV]{Trait}</span></div></div></div><h4>Useful Knowledge</h4><p>In a sentence, describe one bit of knowledge the NPC possesses that might be of use to the player characters. The NPC might know something as banal as the best inn in town or as important as a clue needed to solve<span class=\"No-Break\"> a murder.</span></p><h4>Ideal</h4><p>In a sentence, describe one ideal that the NPC holds dear and which governs his or her greater actions. Player characters who uncover an NPC’s ideal can use what they’ve learned to influence the NPC in a social interaction (as discussed in <a title=\"Running the Game\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/running-the-game\">chapter 8</a><span class=\"No-Break\">).</span></p><p>Ideals can connect to alignment, as shown on the NPC Ideals table.

The backgrounds in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em> can be used to create more detailed flaws. Player characters who uncover an NPC’s flaw or secret can use what they’ve learned to influence the NPC in a social interaction (as discussed in <a title=\"Running the Game\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/running-the-game\">chapter 8</a><span class=\"No-Break\">).</span></p><h5>NPC Flaws and Secrets</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1916166042\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[lsG6B6uraMQ6RX7e]{Flaw or Secret}</span></div></div></div><h3>Monsters as NPCs</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/843/c4-02.png\"></p><p>Named monsters that play a significant role in an adventure deserve the same attention you would give to a humanoid NPC, with mannerisms as well as ideals, bonds, flaws, and secrets. If a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/beholder\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"beholder\">beholder</a> mastermind is behind the criminal activities in a city, don’t rely solely on the entry in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Monster Manual</span></em> to describe the creature’s appearance and personality. Take the time to give it a bit of background, a distinctive quirk of appearance, and especially an ideal, a bond, a<span class=\"No-Break\">nd a flaw.</span></p><p>As an example, consider the Xanathar, a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/beholder\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"beholder\">beholder</a> that runs extensive criminal operations in the city of Waterdeep. The Xanathar’s spherical body is covered in leathery flesh with a texture similar to cobblestones. Its eyestalks are jointed like the legs of an insect, and some of the stalks have magic rings on them. The Xanathar’s speech is slow and deliberate, and it prefers to turn its central eye away from creatures it speaks to. Like all <span class=\"plural-monster-tooltip\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/beholder\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"beholder\">beholder</a>s</span>, it sees other creatures as inferiors, though it understands the usefulness of its humanoid minions. The Xanathar uses the sewers beneath Waterdeep to access virtually any location within or under<span class=\"No-Break\"> the city.</span></p><p>The Xanathar’s ideal is greed. It craves powerful magic items and surrounds itself with gold, platinum, and precious gems. Its bond is to its lair — an elaborate cavern complex carved out between the twisting sewers of Waterdeep, which it inherited from its predecessors and cherishes above all else. Its flaw is a weakness for exotic pleasures: finely prepared foods, scented oils, and rare spices <span class=\"No-Break\">and herbs.</span></p><p>Establishing this information allows you to play the Xanathar as more than an ordinary <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/beholder\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"beholder\">beholder</a>. The complexities of the creature’s characterization create more memorable interaction and interesting story poss<span class=\"No-Break\">ibilities.</span></p><h3>NPC Statistics</h3><p>When you give an NPC game statistics, you have three main options: giving the NPC only the few statistics it needs, give the NPC a monster stat block, or give the NPC a class and levels. The latter two options require a bit of ex<span class=\"No-Break\">planation.</span></p><h4>Using a Monster Stat Block</h4><p>The <em>Monster Manual</em> contains statistics for many generic NPCs that you can customize as you see fit, and <a title=\"Dungeon Master's Workshop\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop\">chapter 9</a>&nbsp;of these rules offers guidelines on adjusting their statistics and creating a new s<span class=\"No-Break\">tat block.</span></p><h4>Using Classes and Levels</h4><p>You can create an NPC just as you would a player character, using the rules in the <span class=\"italic\"><em>Player’s Handbook</em>.</span> You can even use a character sheet to keep track of the NPC’s vital in<span class=\"No-Break\">formation.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Class Options.</span></strong> In addition to the class options in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em>, two additional class options are available for evil player characters and NPCs: the Death domain for clerics and the oathbreaker for paladins. Both options are detailed at the end of thi<span class=\"No-Break\">s chapter.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Equipment.</span></strong> Most NPCs don’t need an exhaustive list of equipment. An enemy meant to be faced in combat requires weapons and armor, plus any treasure the NPC carries (including magic items that might be used against the adv<span class=\"No-Break\">enturers).</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Challenge Rating.</span></strong> An NPC built for combat needs a challenge rating. Use the rules in <a title=\"Dungeon Master's Workshop\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop\">chapter 9</a>&nbsp;to determine the NPC’s challenge rating, just as you would for a monster you<span class=\"No-Break\"> designed.</span></p><h2>NPC Party Members</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/841/c4-03.png\"></p><p>NPCs might join the adventuring party because they want a share of the loot and are willing to accept an equal share of the risk, or they might follow the adventurers because of a bond of loyalty, gratitude, or love. Such NPCs are controlled by you, or you can transfer control to the players. Even if a player controls an NPC, it’s up to you to make sure the NPC is portrayed as a character in his or her own right, not just as a servant that the players can manipulate for their ow<span class=\"No-Break\">n benefit.</span></p><p>Any NPC that accompanies the adventurers acts as a party member and earns a full share of experience points. When determining the difficulty of a combat encounter (see&nbsp;<a title=\"Creating Adventures\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-adventures\">chapter 3</a>), make sure to include all NPC part<span class=\"No-Break\">y members.</span></p><h3>Low-Level Followers</h3><p>Your campaign might allow player characters to take on lower-level NPCs as followers. For example, a paladin might have a 1st-level paladin as a squire, a wizard might accept a 2nd-level wizard as an apprentice, a cleric might choose (or be assigned) a 3rd-level cleric as an acolyte, and a bard might take on a 4th-level bard as an u<span class=\"No-Break\">nderstudy.</span></p><p>One advantage of allowing lower-level characters to join the party is that players have backup characters if their main characters take time off, retire, or die. One disadvantage is that you and your players have more party members to ac<span class=\"No-Break\">count for.</span></p><p>Since lower-level NPC party members receive equal party shares of XP, they will gain levels more quickly than the adventurers (the benefit of studying under such experienced masters), and might eventually catch up to them. It also means the adventurers’ advancement is slowed somewhat, as they must share their XP with an NPC shouldering only part of the adventuri<span class=\"No-Break\">ng burden.</span></p><p>Powerful monsters that are an appropriate challenge for higher-level characters can deal enough damage to instantly kill or incapacitate a low-level follower. The adventurers should expect to spend effort and resources protecting lower-level NPC party members and to provide healing when this protect<span class=\"No-Break\">ion fails.</span></p><h3>Adventurer NPCs</h3><p>If you don’t have enough players to form a full party, you can use NPCs to fill out the ranks. These NPCs should be the same level as the lowest-level adventurer in the party and built (either by you or your players) using the character creation and advancement rules in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em>. It’s easiest on you if you let the players create and run these supporting c<span class=\"No-Break\">haracters.</span></p><p>Encourage players to roleplay supporting characters as true to the NPCs’ personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws as possible, so that they don’t come across as automatons. If you don’t feel that an NPC is being portrayed well, you can take control of the NPC, give it to another player, or simply have the NPC leave <span class=\"No-Break\">the party</span><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><p>NPC supporting characters are easier to play if you limit their class options. Good candidates for supporting characters include a cleric with the Life domain, a fighter with the Champion archetype, a rogue with the Thief archetype, and a wizard specializing in <span class=\"No-Break\">Evocation.</span></p><h3>Optional Rule: Loyalty</h3><p>Loyalty is an optional rule you can use to determine how far an NPC party member will go to protect or assist the other members of the party (even those he or she doesn’t particularly like). An NPC party member who is abused or ignored is likely to abandon or betray the party, whereas an NPC who owes a life debt to the characters or shares their goals might fight to the death for them. Loyalty can be roleplayed or represented by <span class=\"No-Break\">this rule.</span></p><h4>Loyalty Score</h4><p>An NPC’s loyalty is measured on a numerical scale from 0 to 20. The NPC’s maximum loyalty score is equal to the highest Charisma score among all adventurers in the party, and its starting loyalty score is half that number. If the highest Charisma score changes — perhaps a character dies or leaves the group — adjust the NPC’s loyalty score ac<span class=\"No-Break\">cordingly.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/844/c4-04.png\"></p><h4>Tracking Loyalty</h4><p>Keep track of an NPC’s loyalty score in secret so that the players won’t know for sure whether an NPC party member is loyal or disloyal (even if the NPC is currently under a player’s<span class=\"No-Break\"> control).</span></p><p>An NPC’s loyalty score increases by 1d4 if other party members help the NPC achieve a goal tied to its bond. Likewise, an NPC’s loyalty score increases by 1d4 if the NPC is treated particularly well (for example, given a magic weapon as a gift) or rescued by another party member. An NPC’s loyalty score can never be raised above it<span class=\"No-Break\">s maximum.</span></p><p>When other party members act in a manner that runs counter to the NPC’s alignment or bond, reduce the NPC’s loyalty score by 1d4. Reduce the NPC’s loyalty score by 2d4 if the character is abused, misled, or endangered by other party members for purely selfis<span class=\"No-Break\">h reasons.</span></p><p>An NPC whose loyalty score drops to 0 is no longer loyal to the party and might part ways with them. A loyalty score can never dro<span class=\"No-Break\">p below 0.</span></p><p>An NPC with a loyalty score of 10 or higher risks life and limb to help fellow party members. If the NPC’s loyalty score is between 1 and 10, its loyalty is tenuous. An NPC whose loyalty drops to 0 no longer acts in the party’s best interests. The disloyal NPC either leaves the party (attacking characters who attempt to intervene) or works in secret to bring about the party’s<span class=\"No-Break\"> downfall.</span></p><h2>Contacts</h2><p>Contacts are NPCs with close ties to one or more of the player characters. They don’t go on adventures, but they can provide information, rumors, supplies, or professional advice, either for free or at a cost. Some of the backgrounds in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em> suggest contacts for beginning adventurers, and characters are likely to secure more helpful contacts over the course of their adventurin<span class=\"No-Break\">g careers.</span></p><p>A name and a few choice details are all you need for casual contacts, but take the time to flesh out a recurring contact, especially one who might become an ally or enemy at some point. At the very least, give some thought to a contact’s goals and how those goals are likely to come <span class=\"No-Break\">into play.</span></p><h3>Patrons</h3><p>A patron is a contact who employs the adventurers, providing help or rewards as well as quests and adventure hooks. Most of the time, a patron has a vested interest in the adventurers’ success and doesn’t need to be persuaded to <span class=\"No-Break\">help them.</span></p><p>A patron might be a retired adventurer who seeks younger heroes to deal with rising threats, or a mayor who knows that the town guard can’t handle a dragon demanding tribute. A sheriff becomes a patron by offering a bounty for kobold raiders terrorizing the local countryside, as does a noble who wants an abandoned estate cleared of<span class=\"No-Break\"> monsters.</span></p><h2>Hirelings</h2><p>Adventurers can pay NPCs to provide services in a variety of circumstances. Information on hirelings appears in chapter 5, \"<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>\"&nbsp;of the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s</span><span class=\"No-Break\"><span class=\"italic\"> Handbook</span></span></em><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><p>Hireling NPCs rarely become important in an adventure, and most require little development. When adventurers hire a coach to carry them across town or need a letter delivered, the driver or messenger is a hireling, and the adventurers might never even converse with that NPC or learn his or her name. A ship captain carrying the adventurers across the sea is also a hireling, but such a character has the potential to turn into an ally, a patron, or even an enemy as the adventur<span class=\"No-Break\">e unfolds.</span></p><p>When the adventurers hire an NPC for long-term work, add the cost of that NPC’s services to the characters’ lifestyle expenses. See the “<a title=\"Additional Expenses\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/between-adventures#AdditionalExpenses\">Additional Expenses</a>” section of chapter 6, \"<a title=\"Between Adventures\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/between-adventures\">Between Adventures</a>,\" for more in<span class=\"No-Break\">formation.</span></p><h2>Extras</h2><p>Extras are the characters and creatures in the background that the main characters rarely, if ever, inte<span class=\"No-Break\">ract with.</span></p><p>Extras might be elevated to more important roles by virtue of adventurers singling them out. For instance, a player might be hooked by a passing reference you make to a street urchin and try to strike up a conversation with the youngster. Suddenly, an extra on whom you placed no importance becomes a central figure in an improvised roleplay<span class=\"No-Break\">ing scene.</span></p><p>Whenever extras are present, be prepared to come up with names and mannerisms on the fly. In a pinch, you can plunder the race-specific character names found in <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/races\">chapter 2</a> of the <em>Player's Handbook</em><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><h2>Villains</h2><p>By their actions, villains provide job security for heroes. <a title=\"Creating Adventures\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-adventures\">Chapter 3</a>&nbsp;helps you determine suitable villains for your adventures, while this section helps you flesh out their evil schemes, methods, and weaknesses.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must obey the paladin’s commands for the next 24 hours, or until the paladin uses this Channel Divinity option again. An undead whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than the paladin’s level is immune to th<span class=\"No-Break\">is effect.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Dreadful Aspect.</span></strong> As an action, the paladin channels the darkest emotions and focuses them into a burst of magical menace. Each creature of the paladin’s choice within 30 feet of the paladin must make a Wisdom saving throw if it can see the paladin. On a failed save, the target is <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> of the paladin for 1 minute. If a creature <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> by this effect ends its turn more than 30 feet away from the paladin, it can attempt another Wisdom saving throw to end the eff<span class=\"No-Break\">ect on it.</span></p><h4>Aura of Hate</h4><p>Starting at 7th level, the paladin, as well any fiends and undead within 10 feet of the paladin, gains a bonus to melee weapon damage rolls equal to the paladin’s Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). A creature can benefit from this feature from only one paladin <span class=\"No-Break\">at a time.</span></p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases t<span class=\"No-Break\">o 30 feet.</span></p><h4>Supernatural Resistance</h4><p>At 15th level, the paladin gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagica<span class=\"No-Break\">l weapons.</span></p><h4>Dread Lord</h4><p>At 20th-level, the paladin can, as an action, surround himself or herself with an aura of gloom that lasts for 1 minute. The aura reduces any bright light in a 30-foot radius around the paladin to dim light. Whenever an enemy that is <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> by the paladin starts its turn in the aura, it takes 4d10 psychic damage. Additionally, the paladin and creatures he or she chooses in the aura are draped in deeper shadow. Creatures that rely on sight have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures draped in th<span class=\"No-Break\">is shadow.</span></p><p>While the aura lasts, the paladin can use a bonus action on his or her turn to cause the shadows in the aura to attack one creature. The paladin makes a melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the target takes necrotic damage equal to 3d10 + the paladin’s Charisma<span class=\"No-Break\"> modifier.</span></p><p>After activating the aura, the paladin can’t do so again until he or she finishes a <span class=\"No-Break\">long rest.</span></p><div>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>OATHBREAKER ATONEMENT</strong></p>\n<p>If you allow a player to choose the Oathbreaker option, you can later allow the paladin to atone and become a true paladin <span class=\"No-Break\">once more.</span></p>\n<p>The paladin who wishes to atone must first shed his or her evil alignment and demonstrate this alignment change through words and deeds. Having done so, the paladin loses all Oathbreaker features and must choose a deity and a sacred oath. (With your permission, the player can select a different deity or sacred oath than the character had previously.) However, the paladin doesn’t gain the class features specific to that sacred oath until he or she completes some kind of dangerous quest or trial, as determined <span class=\"No-Break\">by the DM.</span></p>\n<p>A paladin who breaks his or her sacred oath a second time can become an oathbreaker once more, but ca<span class=\"No-Break\">n’t atone.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>","img":null,"_id":"02YYMw9Ci5D6DWR0"}

Dungeons in D&amp;D include great halls and tombs, subterranean monster lairs, labyrinths riddled with death traps, natural caverns extending for miles beneath the surface of the world, and ruine<span class=\"No-Break\">d castles.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/845/c5-02.png\"></p><p>Not every adventure takes place in a dungeon. A wilderness trek across the Desert of Desolation or a harrowing journey into the jungles of the Isle of Dread can be an exciting adventure in its own right. In the great outdoors, dragons wheel across the sky in search of prey, tribes of hobgoblins pour forth from their grim fortresses to wage war against their neighbors, ogres plunder farmsteads for food, and monstrous spiders drop from the web-shrouded canopies<span class=\"No-Break\"> of trees.</span></p><p>Within a dungeon, adventurers are constrained by walls and doors around them, but in the wilderness, adventurers can travel in almost any direction they please. Therein lies the key difference between dungeon and wilderness: it’s much easier to predict where the adventuring party might go in the dungeon because the options are limited — less so in the wilderness.</p><p>Villages, towns, and cities are cradles of civilization in a dangerous world, but they too offer opportunities for adventure. Encounters with monsters might seem unlikely within a city’s walls, but urban settings have their own villains and perils. Evil, after all, takes many forms, and urban settings aren’t always the safe havens they s<span class=\"No-Break\">eem to be.</span></p><p>This chapter&nbsp;provides an overview of these three environments plus a few unusual environments, taking you through the process of creating an adventure location, with plenty of random tables to in<span class=\"No-Break\">spire you.</span></p><h2>Dungeons</h2><p>Some dungeons are old strongholds abandoned by the folk who built them. Others are natural caves or weird lairs carved out by foul monsters. They attract evil cults, monster tribes, and reclusive creatures. Dungeons are also home to ancient treasures: coins, gems, magic items, and other valuables hidden away in the darkness, often guarded by traps or jealously kept by the monsters that have colle<span class=\"No-Break\">cted them.</span></p><h3>Building a Dungeon</h3><p>When you set out to create a dungeon, think about its distinctive qualities. For example, a dungeon that serves as a hobgoblin stronghold has a different quality from an ancient temple inhabited by yuan-ti. This section lays out a process for creating a dungeon and bringing i<span class=\"No-Break\">t to life.</span></p><h4>Dungeon Location</h4><p>You can use the Dungeon Location table to determine the locale of your dungeon. You can roll on the table or choose an entry that ins<span class=\"No-Break\">pires you.</span></p><h5>Dungeon Location</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"265312872\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[ZVw3AuFBDrTgCnfK]{Location}</span></div></div></div><h5>Exotic Location</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"2050734308\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[3H9FIAHC1siCqwQF]{Location}</span></div></div></div><h4>Dungeon Creator</h4><p>A dungeon reflects its creators. A lost temple of the yuan-ti, choked by overgrown jungle plants, might feature ramps instead of stairs. Caverns carved by a beholder’s disintegration eye ray have walls that are unnaturally smooth, and the beholder’s lair might include vertical shafts connecting different levels. Amphibious monsters such as kuo-toa and aboleths use water to protect the innermost reaches of their lairs from air-breathing <span class=\"No-Break\">intruders.</span></p><p>Details bring a dungeon setting’s personality to life. Great bearded faces might be carved on the doors of a dwarven stronghold and might be defaced by the gnolls who live there now. Spiderweb decorations, torture chambers, and slave pens might be common features in a vault built by drow, telling something about that location and its occupants.</p><p>The Dungeon Creator table includes creatures that typically build dungeons. You can choose a creator from the table or roll randomly, or choose some other dungeon builder appropriate for your<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><h5>Dungeon Creator</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1318983495\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[dFe4F1xxxLf3MRjj]{Creator}</span></div></div></div><h5>Cults and Religious Groups</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1581457926\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[Cch9UTAwk8Zy0mv0]{Cult or Religious Group}</span></div></div></div><h5>NPC Alignment</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"831674697\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[tRsVDtUkNa6Izsx9]{Alignment}</span></div></div></div><h5>NPC Class</h5><div><table class=\"compendium-medium-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"environments-short-header\">d20</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Class</th>\n<th class=\"environments-short-header\">d20</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Class</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Barbarian</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Paladin</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Bard</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Ranger</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3–4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Cleric</td>\n<td>11–14</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Rogue</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Druid</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Sorcerer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6–7</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Fighter</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Warlock</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Monk</td>\n<td>17–20</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wizard</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h4>Dungeon Purpose</h4><p>Except in the case of a natural cavern, a dungeon is crafted and inhabited for a specific purpose that influences its design and features.

Particularly old dungeons can have a history that consists of multiple events, each of which transformed the site in<span class=\"No-Break\"> some way.</span></p><h5>Dungeon History</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-174255791\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[7Q9ZnryCCisdbzgB]{Key Event}</span></div></div></div><h3>Dungeon Inhabitants</h3><p>After a dungeon’s creators depart, anyone or anything might move in. Intelligent monsters, mindless dungeon scavengers, predators and prey alike can be drawn to<span class=\"No-Break\"> dungeons.</span></p><p>The monsters in a dungeon are more than a collection of random creatures that happen to live near one another. Fungi, vermin, scavengers, and predators can coexist in a complex ecology, alongside intelligent creatures who share living space through elaborate combinations of domination, negotiation, and <span class=\"No-Break\">bloodshed.</span></p><p>Characters might be able to sneak into a dungeon, ally with one faction, or play factions against each other to reduce the threat of the more powerful monsters. For example, in a dungeon inhabited by mind flayers and their goblinoid thralls, the adventurers might try to incite the goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears to revolt against their illithi<span class=\"No-Break\">d masters.</span></p><h4>Dungeon Factions</h4><p>A dungeon is sometimes dominated by a single group of intelligent humanoids, whether a tribe of orcs that have taken over a cavern complex or a gang of trolls inhabiting an aboveground ruin. Other times, particularly in larger dungeons, multiple groups of creatures share space and compete for <span class=\"No-Break\">resources.</span></p><p>For example, orcs that dwell in the mines of a ruined dwarf citadel might skirmish constantly against the hobgoblins that hold the citadel’s upper tiers. Mind flayers that have established a colony in the lowest levels of the mines could manipulate and dominate key hobgoblins in an attempt to wipe out the orcs. And all the while, a hidden cell of drow scouts watches and plots to slay the mind flayers, then enslave whatever creatures<span class=\"No-Break\"> are left.</span></p><p>It’s easy to think of a dungeon as a collection of encounters, with the adventurers kicking down door after door and killing whatever lies beyond. But the ebb and flow of power between groups in a dungeon provides plenty of opportunities for more subtle interaction. Dungeon denizens are used to striking unlikely alliances, and adventurers are a wild card that canny monsters seek t<span class=\"No-Break\">o exploit.</span></p><p>Intelligent creatures in a dungeon have goals, whether as simple as short-term survival or as ambitious as claiming the entire dungeon as the first step in founding an empire. Such creatures might approach adventurers with an offer of alliance, hoping to prevent the characters from laying waste to their lair and to secure aid against their enemies. Bring the NPC leaders of such groups to life as described in <a title=\"Creating Nonplayer Characters\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters\">chapter 4</a>, fleshing out their personalities, goals, and ideals. Then use those elements to shape a response to the arrival of adventurers in their <span class=\"No-Break\">territory.</span></p><h4>Dungeon Ecology</h4><p>An inhabited dungeon has its own ecosystem. The creatures that live there need to eat, drink, breathe, and sleep, just as creatures in the wilderness do. Predators need to be able to seek prey, and intelligent creatures search for lairs offering the best combination of air, food, water, and security. Keep these factors in mind when designing a dungeon you want the players to believe in. If a dungeon doesn’t have some internal logic to it, adventurers will find it difficult to make reasonable decisions within that en<span class=\"No-Break\">vironment.</span></p><p>For example, characters who find a pool of fresh water in a dungeon might make the logical assumption that many of the creatures inhabiting the dungeon come to that spot to drink. The adventurers might set an ambush at the pool. Likewise, locked doors — or even doors that require hands to open — can restrict the movement of some creatures. If all the doors in a dungeon are closed, the players might wonder how the carrion crawlers or stirges they repeatedly encounter manage t<span class=\"No-Break\">o survive.</span></p><h4>Encounter Difficulty</h4><p>You might be inclined to increase the encounter difficulty as the adventurers descend deeper into the dungeon, as a way to keep the dungeon challenging as the characters gain levels or to ratchet up the tension. However, this approach can turn the dungeon into a grind. A better approach is to include encounters of varying difficulty throughout. The contrast between easy and hard encounters, as well as simple and complex encounters, encourages characters to vary their tactics and keeps the encounters from seeming to<span class=\"No-Break\">o similar.</span></p><h2>Mapping a Dungeon</h2><p>Every dungeon needs a map showing its layout. The dungeon’s location, creator, purpose, history, and inhabitants should give you a starting point for designing your dungeon map. If you need further inspiration, you can find maps that have been made freely available for use on the Internet, or even use a map of a real-world location. Alternatively, you can borrow a map from a published adventure or randomly generate a dungeon complex using the tables presented in the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/appendix-a-random-dungeons\">Appendices</a>.</p><p>A dungeon can range in size from a few chambers in a ruined temple to a huge complex of rooms and passages extending hundreds of feet in all directions. The adventurers’ goal often lies as far from the dungeon entrance as possible, forcing characters to delve deeper underground or push farther into the heart of th<span class=\"No-Break\">e complex.</span></p><p>A dungeon is most easily mapped on graph paper, with each square on the paper representing an area of 10 feet by 10 feet. (If you play with miniatures on a grid, you might prefer a scale where each square represents 5 feet, or you can subdivide your 10-foot grid into a 5-foot grid when you draw your maps for combat.) When you draw your map, keep the following point<span class=\"No-Break\">s in mind:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Asymmetrical rooms and map layouts make a dungeon less pr<span class=\"No-Break\">edictable.</span></li>\n<li>Think in three dimensions. Stairs, ramps, platforms, ledges, balconies, pits, and other changes of elevation make a dungeon more interesting and make combat encounters in those areas more ch<span class=\"No-Break\">allenging.</span></li>\n<li>Give the dungeon some wear and tear. Unless you want to stress that the dungeon’s builders were extraordinarily skillful, collapsed passages can be commonplace, cutting off formerly connected sections of the dungeon from each other. Past earthquakes might have opened chasms within a dungeon, splitting rooms and corridors to make interesting <span class=\"No-Break\">obstacles.</span></li>\n<li>Incorporate natural features into even a constructed dungeon. An underground stream might run through the middle of a dwarven stronghold, causing variation in the shapes and sizes of rooms and necessitating features such as bridges a<span class=\"No-Break\">nd drains.</span></li>\n<li>Add multiple entrances and exits. Nothing gives the players a stronger sense of making real decisions than having multiple ways to enter <span class=\"No-Break\">a dungeon.</span></li>\n<li>Add secret doors and secret rooms to reward players who take the time to search<span class=\"No-Break\"> for them.</span></li>\n</ul><p>If you need help creating a dungeon map from scratch, see <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/appendix-a-random-dungeons\">Appendices</a>.</p><h3>Dungeon Features</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/846/c5-03.png\"></p><p>The atmosphere and physical characteristics of dungeons vary as widely as their origins. An old crypt might have stone walls and loose wooden doors, an odor of decay, and no light other than what adventurers bring with them. A volcanic lair might have smooth stone walls hollowed out by past eruptions, doors of magically reinforced brass, a smell of sulfur, and light provided by jets of flame in every hall<span class=\"No-Break\"> and room.</span></p><h4>Walls</h4><p>Some dungeons have walls of masonry. Others have walls of solid rock, hewn with tools to give them a rough, chiseled look, or worn smooth by the passage of water or lava. An aboveground dungeon might be made of wood or composite <span class=\"No-Break\">materials.</span></p><p>Walls are sometimes adorned with murals, frescoes, bas-reliefs, and lighting fixtures such as sconces or torch brackets. A few even have secret doors built <span class=\"No-Break\">into them.</span></p><h4>Doors</h4><p>Dungeon doorways might be set within plain arches and lintels. They might be festooned with carvings of gargoyles or leering faces or engraved with sigils that reveal clues as to what li<span class=\"No-Break\">es beyond.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Stuck Doors.</span></strong> Dungeon doors often become stuck when not used frequently. Opening a stuck door requires a successful Strength check. Chapter 8, \"<a title=\"Running the Game\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/running-the-game\">Running the Game</a>,\"&nbsp;provides guidelines for setti<span class=\"No-Break\">ng the DC.</span></p><p><span class=\"italic\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/858/c5-04.png\"></span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Locked Doors.</span></strong> Characters who don’t have the key to a locked door can pick the lock with a successful Dexterity check (doing so requires thieves’ tools and proficiency in their use). They can also force the door with a successful Strength check, smash the door to pieces by dealing enough damage to it, or use a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/knock\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"knock\">knock</a></span> spell or similar magic. <a title=\"Running the Game\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/running-the-game\">Chapter 8</a>&nbsp;provides guidelines for setting the DCs and assigning statistics to doors and othe<span class=\"No-Break\">r objects.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Barred Doors. </span></strong>A barred door is similar to a locked door, except that there’s no lock to pick, and the door can be opened normally from the barred side by using an action to lift the bar from i<span class=\"No-Break\">ts braces.</span></p><h4>Secret Doors</h4><p>A secret door is crafted to blend into the wall that surrounds it. Sometimes faint cracks in the wall or scuff marks on the floor betray the secret door’s<span class=\"No-Break\"> presence.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Detecting a Secret Door.</span></strong> Use the characters’ passive Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) scores to determine whether anyone in the party notices a secret door without actively searching for it. Characters can also find a secret door by actively searching the location where the door is hidden and succeeding on a Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) check. To set an appropriate DC for the check, see <a title=\"Running the Game\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/running-the-game\">chapter 8</a><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Opening a Secret Door.</span></strong> Once a secret door is detected, a successful Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\">Investigation</a>) check might be required to determine how to open it if the opening mechanism isn’t obvious. Set the DC according to the difficulty guidelines in <a title=\"Running the Game\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/running-the-game\">chapter 8</a><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><p>If adventurers can’t determine how to open a secret door, breaking it down is always an option. Treat it as a locked door made of the same material as the surrounding wall, and use the guidelines in the <a title=\"Running the Game\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/running-the-game\">Running the Game</a> section&nbsp;to determine appropriate DCs or s<span class=\"No-Break\">tatistics.</span></p><h4>Concealed Doors</h4><p>A concealed door is a normal door that is hidden from view. A secret door is carefully crafted to blend into its surrounding surface, whereas a concealed door is most often hidden by mundane means. It might be covered by a tapestry, covered with plaster, or (in the case of a concealed trapdoor) hidden under a rug. Normally, no ability check is required to find a concealed door. A character need only look in the right place or take the right steps to reveal the door. However, you can use the characters’ passive Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) scores to determine whether any of them notices tracks or signs of a tapestry or rug having been recently <span class=\"No-Break\">disturbed.</span></p><h4>Portcullises</h4><p>A portcullis is a set of vertical bars made of wood or iron, reinforced with one or more horizontal bands. It blocks a passage or archway until it is raised up into the ceiling by a winch and chain. The main benefit of a portcullis is that it blocks a passage while still allowing guards to watch the area beyond and make ranged attacks or cast spells t<span class=\"No-Break\">hrough it.</span></p><p>Winching a portcullis up or down requires an action. If a character can’t reach the winch (usually because it is on the other side of the portcullis), lifting the portcullis or bending its bars far enough apart to pass through them requires a successful Strength check. The DC of the check depends on the size and weight of the portcullis or the thickness of its bars. To determine an appropriate DC, see <a title=\"Running the Game\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/running-the-game\">chapter 8</a><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><h4>Darkness and Light</h4><p>Darkness is the default condition inside an underground complex or in the interior of aboveground ruins, but an inhabited dungeon might have ligh<span class=\"No-Break\">t sources.</span></p><p>In subterranean settlements, even races that have darkvision use fire for warmth, cooking, and defense. But many creatures have no need of warmth or light. Adventurers must bring their own sources of light into dusty tombs where only undead stand guard, abandoned ruins teeming with predatory monsters and oozes, and natural caverns where sightless creat<span class=\"No-Break\">ures hunt.</span></p><p>The light of a torch or lantern helps a character see over a short distance, but other creatures can see that light source from far away. Bright light in an environment of total darkness can be visible for miles, though a clear line of sight over such a distance is rare underground. Even so, adventurers using light sources in a dungeon often attract monsters, just as dungeon features that shed light (from phosphorescent fungi to the glow of magical portals) can draw adventurers’ <span class=\"No-Break\">attention.</span></p><h4>Air Quality</h4><p>Subterranean tunnels and aboveground ruins are often enclosed spaces with little airflow. Though it’s rare for a dungeon to be sealed so tightly that adventurers have trouble breathing, the atmosphere is often stifling and oppressive. What’s more, odors linger in a dungeon and can be magnified by the stillness of the a<span class=\"No-Break\">tmosphere.</span></p><h4>Sounds</h4><p>A dungeon’s enclosed geography helps channel sound. The groaning creak of an opening door can echo down hundreds of feet of passageway. Louder noises such as the clanging hammers of a forge or the din of battle can reverberate through an entire dungeon. Many creatures that live underground use such sounds as a way of locating prey, or go on alert at any sound of an adventuring party’s <span class=\"No-Break\">intrusion.</span></p><h3>Dungeon Hazards</h3><p>The hazards described here are but a few examples of the environmental dangers found underground and in other dark places. Dungeon hazards are functionally similar to traps, which are described at the end of thi<span class=\"No-Break\">s section.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Detecting a Hazard.</span></strong> No ability check is required to spot a hazard unless it is hidden. A hazard that resembles something benign, such as a patch of slime or mold, can be correctly identified with a successful Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Nature\">Nature</a>) check. Use the guidelines in <a title=\"Running the Game\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/running-the-game\">chapter 8</a>&nbsp;to set an appropriate DC for any check made to spot or recognize<span class=\"No-Break\"> a hazard.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Hazard Severity. </span></strong>To determine a hazard’s deadliness relative to the characters, think of the hazard as a trap and compare the damage it deals with the party’s level using the Damage Severity by Level table later in the chapter&nbsp;(the table also appears in <a title=\"Running the Game\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/running-the-game\">chapter 8</a><span class=\"No-Break\">).</span></p><h4>Brown Mold</h4><p>Brown mold feeds on warmth, drawing heat from anything around it. A patch of brown mold typically covers a 10-foot square, and the temperature within 30 feet of it is alwa<span class=\"No-Break\">ys frigid.</span></p><p>When a creature moves to within 5 feet of the mold for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a succe<span class=\"No-Break\">ssful one.</span></p><p>Brown mold is immune to fire, and any source of fire brought within 5 feet of a patch causes it to instantly expand outward in the direction of the fire, covering a 10-foot-square area (with the source of the fire at the center of that area). A patch of brown mold exposed to an effect that deals cold damage is instantly <span class=\"No-Break\">destroyed.</span></p><h4>Green Slime</h4><p>This acidic slime devours flesh, organic material, and metal on contact. Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings to walls, floors, and ceilings i<span class=\"No-Break\">n patches.</span></p><p>A patch of green slime covers a 5-foot square, has blindsight out to a range of 30 feet, and drops from walls and ceilings when it detects movement below it. Beyond that, it has no ability to move. A creature aware of the slime’s presence can avoid being struck by it with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the slime can’t be avoided as<span class=\"No-Break\"> it drops.</span></p><p>A creature that comes into contact with green slime takes 5 (1d10) acid damage. The creature takes the damage again at the start of each of its turns until the slime is scraped off or destroyed. Against wood or metal, green slime deals 11 (2d10) acid damage each round, and any nonmagical wood or metal weapon or tool used to scrape off the slime is effectively <span class=\"No-Break\">destroyed.</span></p><p>Sunlight, any effect that cures disease, and any effect that deals cold, fire, or radiant damage destroys a patch of gr<span class=\"No-Break\">een slime.</span></p><h4>Webs</h4><p>Giant spiders weave thick, sticky webs across passages and at the bottom of pits to snare prey. These web-filled areas are difficult terrain. Moreover, a creature entering a webbed area for the first time on a turn or starting its turn there must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or become <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained\">restrained</a> by the webs. A <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained\">restrained</a> creature can use its action to try to escape, doing so with a successful DC 12 Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) or Dexterity (Acrobati<span class=\"No-Break\">cs) check.</span></p><p>Each 10-foot cube of giant webs has AC 10, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and psych<span class=\"No-Break\">ic damage.</span></p><h4>Yellow Mold</h4><p>Yellow mold grows in dark places, and one patch covers a 5-foot square. If touched, the mold ejects a cloud of spores that fills a 10-foot cube originating from the mold. Any creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) poison damage and become <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Poisoned\">poisoned</a> for 1 minute. While <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Poisoned\">poisoned</a> in this way, the creature takes 5 (1d10) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a succes<span class=\"No-Break\">sful save.</span></p><p>Sunlight or any amount of fire damage instantly destroys one patch of ye<span class=\"No-Break\">llow mold.</span></p><h2>Wilderness</h2><p>Between the dungeons and settlements of your campaign world lie meadows, forests, deserts, mountain ranges, oceans, and other tracts of wilderness waiting to be traversed. Bringing wilderness areas to life can be a fun part of your game, both for you and your players. The following two approaches work particul<span class=\"No-Break\">arly well.</span></p><h3>Travel-Montage Approach</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/848/c5-05.png\"></p><p>Sometimes the destination is more important than the journey. If the purpose of a wilderness trek is to get the characters to where the real adventure happens, gloss over the wilderness trek without checking for encounters along the way. Just as movies use travel montages to convey long and arduous journeys in a matter of seconds, you can use a few sentences of descriptive text to paint a picture of a wilderness trek in your players’ minds before <span class=\"No-Break\">moving on.</span></p><p>Describe the journey as vividly as you like, but keep the forward momentum. “You walk for several miles and encounter nothing of interest” is okay, but far less evocative and memorable than, “A light rain dampens the rolling plains as you travel north. Around midday, you break for lunch under a lonely tree. There, the rogue finds a small rock that looks like a grinning face, but otherwise you encounter nothing out of the ordinary.” The trick is to focus on a few details that reinforce the desired mood rather than describe everything down to the last blade<span class=\"No-Break\"> of grass.</span></p><p>Call attention to unusual terrain features: a waterfall, a rocky outcropping that offers a breathtaking view over the tops of the surrounding trees, an area where the forest has burned or been cut down, and so on. Also describe notable smells and sounds, such as the roar of a faraway monster, the stench of burned wood, or the sweet aroma of flowers in an elv<span class=\"No-Break\">en forest.</span></p><p>In addition to evocative language, visual aids can help set the scene for the characters’ travels. Image searches on the Internet can lead you to breathtaking landscapes (in fact, that’s a good phrase to search for) both real and fantastical. As striking as real-world scenery can be, wilderness travel can be used to remind the players that their characters are in a fantasy world. Once in a while, spice up your descriptions with some truly magical element. A forest might be home to tiny dragonets instead of birds, or its trees might be festooned with giant webs or have eerie, green-glowing sap. Use these elements sparingly; landscapes that are too alien can break your players’ sense of immersion in the world. A single fantastic element within an otherwise realistic and memorable landscape <span class=\"No-Break\">is enough.</span></p><p>Use the landscape to set the mood and tone for your adventure. In one forest, close-set trees shroud all light and seem to watch the adventurers as they pass. In another, sunlight streams through the leaves above and flower-laden vines twine up every trunk. Signs of corruption — rotting wood, foul-smelling water, and rocks covered with slimy brown moss — can be a signal that the adventurers are drawing close to the site of evil power that is their destination or can provide clues to the nature of the threats to be fo<span class=\"No-Break\">und there.</span></p><p>Specific wilderness locations might have their own special features. For example, the Spirit Forest and the Spiderhaunt Woods might feature different kinds of trees, different kinds of flora and fauna, different weather, and different random encount<span class=\"No-Break\">er tables.</span></p><p>Finally, a wilderness trek can be enhanced by calling attention to the weather. “You spend the next three days crossing the swamp” sounds less harrowing than, “You spend the next three days trudging through knee-deep mud — the first two days and nights in the pouring rain, and then another day under the beating sun, with swarms of hungry insects feasting on yo<span class=\"No-Break\">ur blood.”</span></p><h3>Hour-by-Hour Approach</h3><p>Sometimes the journey deserves as much time and attention as the destination. If wilderness travel features prominently in your adventure and isn’t something you want to gloss over, you will need more than a descriptive overview to bring a long and harrowing journey to life; you’ll need to know the party’s marching order and have encounters at <span class=\"No-Break\">the ready.</span></p><p>Let your players determine the party’s marching order (see the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em> for more information). Characters in the front rank are likely to be the first to notice landmarks and terrain features, as well as the ones responsible for navigating. Characters in the back rank are usually responsible for making sure that the party isn’t being followed. Encourage characters in the middle ranks to do something other than blindly trudge along behind the front-rank characters. The <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em> suggests activities such as mapmaking and foraging<span class=\"No-Break\"> for food.</span></p><p>Wilderness journeys typically feature a combination of planned encounters (encounters that you prepare ahead of time) and random encounters (encounters determined by rolling on a table). A planned encounter might need a map of the location where the encounter is set to occur, such as a ruin, a bridge spanning a gorge, or some other memorable location. Random encounters tend to be less location-specific. The fewer planned encounters you have, the more you’ll need to rely on random encounters to keep the journey interesting. See <a title=\"Creating Adventures\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-adventures\">chapter 3</a>&nbsp;for guidelines on creating your own random encounter tables and when to check for random e<span class=\"No-Break\">ncounters.</span></p><p>A good way to keep wilderness encounters from becoming stale is to make sure they don’t all start and end the same way. In other words, if the wilderness is your stage and your adventure is the play or movie, think of each wilderness encounter as its own scene, and try to stage each one in a slightly different way to keep your players’ interest. If one encounter comes at the adventurers from the front, the next one might come at them from above or behind. If an encounter features stealthy monsters, a character tending to the party’s pack animals might get the first indication that monsters are near when a pony whickers nervously. If an encounter features loud monsters, the party might have the option to hide or set an ambush. One group of monsters might attack the party on sight, and another might allow safe passage<span class=\"No-Break\"> for food.</span></p><p>Reward characters for searching while they travel by providing things for them to find. Broken statues, tracks, abandoned campsites, and other finds can add flavor to your world, foreshadow future encounters or events, or provide hooks for further a<span class=\"No-Break\">dventures.</span></p><p>A wilderness journey might take multiple sessions to play out. That said, if the wilderness journey includes long periods with no encounters, use the travel-montage approach to bridge gaps between e<span class=\"No-Break\">ncounters.</span></p><h2>Mapping a Wilderness</h2><p>In contrast to a dungeon, an outdoor setting presents seemingly limitless options. The adventurers can move in any direction over a trackless desert or an open grassland, so how do you as the DM deal with all the possible locations and events that might make up a wilderness campaign? What if you design an encounter in a desert oasis, but the characters miss the oasis because they wander off course? How do you avoid creating a boring play session of uninterrupted slogging across a rocky <span class=\"No-Break\">wasteland?</span></p><p>One solution is to think of an outdoor setting in the same way you think about a dungeon. Even the most wide-open terrain presents clear pathways. Roads seldom run straight because they follow the contours of the land, finding the most level or otherwise easiest routes across uneven ground. Valleys and ridges channel travel in certain directions. Mountain ranges present forbidding barriers traversed only by remote passes. Even the most trackless desert reveals favored routes, where explorers and caravan drivers have discovered areas of wind-blasted rock that are easier to traverse than shifting sand.</p><p>If the party veers off track, you might be able to relocate one or more of your planned encounters elsewhere on the map to ensure that the time spent preparing those encounters doesn’t go<span class=\"No-Break\"> to waste.</span></p><p><a title=\"A World of Your Own\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/a-world-of-your-own\">Chapter 1</a>&nbsp;discusses the basics of creating a wilderness map at three different scales to help you design your world and the starting area of your campaign. Especially when you get down to province scale (1 hex = 1 mile), think about paths of travel — roads, passes, ridges and valleys, and so on — that can guide character movement across<span class=\"No-Break\"> your map.</span></p><h3>Movement on the Map</h3><p>Narrate wilderness travel at a level of detail appropriate to the map you’re using. If you’re tracking hour-by-hour movement on a province-scale map (1 hex = 1 mile), you can describe each hamlet the adventurers pass. At this scale, you can assume that the characters find a noteworthy location when they enter its hex unless the site is specifically hidden. The characters might not walk directly up to the front door of a ruined castle when they enter a hex, but they can find old paths, outlying ruins, and other signs of its presence in<span class=\"No-Break\"> the area.</span></p><p>If you’re tracking a journey of several days on a kingdom-scale map (1 hex = 6 miles), don’t bother with details too small to appear on your map. It’s enough for the players to know that on the third day of their journey, they cross a river and the land starts rising before them, and that they reach the mountain pass two d<span class=\"No-Break\">ays later.</span></p><h3>Wilderness Features</h3><p>No wilderness map is complete without a few settlements, strongholds, ruins, and other sites worthy of discovery. A dozen such locations scattered over an area roughly 50 miles across is a g<span class=\"No-Break\">ood start.</span></p><h4>Monster Lairs</h4><p>A wilderness area approximately 50 miles across can support roughly a half-dozen monster lairs, but probably no more than one apex predator such as<span class=\"No-Break\"> a dragon.</span></p><p>If you expect the characters to explore a monster’s lair, you’ll need to find or create an appropriate map for the lair and stock the lair as you would <span class=\"No-Break\">a dungeon.</span></p><h4>Monuments</h4><p>In places where civilization rules or once ruled, adventurers might find monuments built to honor great leaders, gods, and cultures. Use the Monuments table for inspiration, or randomly roll to determine what monument the adventurers stu<span class=\"No-Break\">mble upon.</span></p><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"717268331\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[MsHcNHCFjHbsukTT]{Monument}</span></div></div></div><h4>Ruins</h4><p>Crumbling towers, ancient temples, and razed cities are perfect sites for adventures. Additionally, noting the existence of an old, crumbling wall that runs alongside a road, a sagging stone windmill on a hilltop, or a jumble of standing stones can add texture to your w<span class=\"No-Break\">ilderness.</span></p><h4>Settlements</h4><p>Settlements exist in places where food, water, farmland, and building materials are abundant. A civilized province roughly 50 miles across might have one city, a few rural towns, and a scattering of villages and trading posts. An uncivilized area might have a single trading post that stands at the edge of a wild frontier, but no larger se<span class=\"No-Break\">ttlements.</span></p><p>In addition to settlements, a province might contain ruined villages and towns that are either abandoned or serve as lairs for marauding bandits and<span class=\"No-Break\"> monsters.</span></p><h4>Strongholds</h4><p>Strongholds provide the local population with protection in times of trouble. The number of strongholds in an area depends on the dominant society, the population, the strategic importance or vulnerability of the region, and the wealth of<span class=\"No-Break\"> the land.</span></p><h4>Weird Locales</h4><p>Weird locales make the fantastic and the supernatural an intrinsic part of your wilderness a<span class=\"No-Break\">dventures.</span></p><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"521058495\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[Ds3dHrnp2wv0ly6i]{Locale}</span></div></div></div><h2>Wilderness Survival</h2><p>Adventuring in the wilderness presents a host of perils beyond the threats of monstrous predators and savag<span class=\"No-Break\">e raiders.</span></p><h3>Weather</h3><p>You can pick weather to fit your campaign or roll on the Weather table to determine the weather for a given day, adjusting for the terrain and season as ap<span class=\"No-Break\">propriate.</span></p><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1674176125\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[pqnPJiYzSkxOOtJ3]{Temperature}</span></div></div></div><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1674176124\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[fn1VV6RPHc7W43zx]{Wind}</span></div></div></div><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1674176123\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[GfiXr6iDUVZPfMRy]{Precipitation}</span></div></div></div><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/849/c5-06.png\"></p><h4>Extreme Cold</h4><p>Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a>.

The DC is 5 for the first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour. Creatures wearing medium or heavy armor, or who are clad in heavy clothing, have disadvantage on the saving throw.

Others, such as defiled ground, are undetectable by normal senses. The other hazards presented here can be identified with a successful Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Nature\">Nature</a>) check. Use the guidelines in <a title=\"Running the Game\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/running-the-game\">chapter 8</a>&nbsp;to set an appropriate DC for any check made to spot or recognize<span class=\"No-Break\"> a hazard.</span></p><h4>Desecrated Ground</h4><p>Some cemeteries and catacombs are imbued with the unseen traces of ancient evil. An area of desecrated ground can be any size, and a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-evil-and-good\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"detect evil and good\">detect evil and good</a> spell cast within range reveals its presence.</p><p>Undead standing on desecrated ground have advantage on all saving throws.</p><p>A vial of holy water purifies a 10-foot-square area of desecrated ground when sprinkled on it, and a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hallow\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"hallow\">hallow</a> spell purifies desecrated ground within its area.</p><h4>Frigid Water</h4><p>A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a>. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in ice-c<span class=\"No-Break\">old water.</span></p><h4>Quicksand</h4><p>A quicksand pit covers the ground in roughly a 10-foot-square area and is usually 10 feet deep. When a creature enters the area, it sinks 1d4 + 1 feet into the quicksand and becomes <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained\">restrained</a>. At the start of each of the creature’s turns, it sinks another 1d4 feet. As long as the creature isn’t completely submerged in quicksand, it can escape by using its action and succeeding on a Strength check. The DC is 10 plus the number of feet the creature has sunk into the quicksand. A creature that is completely submerged in quicksand can’t breathe (see the suffocation rules in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s </span><span class=\"No-Break\"><span class=\"italic\">Handbook</span></span></em><span class=\"No-Break\">).</span></p><p>A creature can pull another creature within its reach out of a quicksand pit by using its action and succeeding on a Strength check. The DC is 5 plus the number of feet the target creature has sunk into the <span class=\"No-Break\">quicksand.</span></p><h4>Razorvine</h4><p>Razorvine is a plant that grows in wild tangles and hedges. It also clings to the sides of buildings and other surfaces as ivy does. A 10-foot-high, 10-foot-wide, 5-foot-thick wall or hedge of razorvine has AC 11, 25 hit points, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and psych<span class=\"No-Break\">ic damage.</span></p><p>When a creature comes into direct contact with razorvine for the first time on a turn, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (1d10) slashing damage from the razorvine’s bladeli<span class=\"No-Break\">ke thorns.</span></p><h4>Slippery Ice</h4><p>Slippery ice is difficult terrain. When a creature moves onto slippery ice for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>) check or f<span class=\"No-Break\">all <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a>.</span></p><h4>Thin Ice</h4><p>Thin ice has a weight tolerance of 3d10 × 10 pounds per 10-foot-square area. Whenever the total weight on an area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice in that area breaks. All creatures on broken ice fal<span class=\"No-Break\">l through.</span></p><h3>Foraging</h3><p>Characters can gather food and water as the party travels at a normal or slow pace. A foraging character makes a Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival\">Survival</a>) check whenever you call for it, with the DC determined by the abundance of food and water in t<span class=\"No-Break\">he region.</span></p><h5>Foraging DCs</h5><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Food and Water Availability</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\">DC</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Abundant food and water sources</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Limited food and water sources</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Very little, if any, food and water sources</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">20</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p>If multiple characters forage, each character makes a separate check.

Horses and other creatures require different quantities of food and water per day based on their size.

The party’s navigator makes a Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival\">Survival</a>) check when you decide it’s appropriate, against a DC determined by the prevailing terrain, as shown on the Wilderness Navigation table. If the party is moving at a slow pace, the navigator gains a +5 bonus to the check, and a fast pace imposes a −5 penalty. If the party has an accurate map of the region or can see the sun or stars, the navigator has advantage on <span class=\"No-Break\">the check.</span></p><p>If the Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival\">Survival</a>) check succeeds, the party travels in the desired direction without becoming lost.

Settlement</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/852/c5-09.png\"></p><p>When you draw a map for a settlement in your game, don’t worry about the placement of every building, and concentrate instead on the major<span class=\"No-Break\"> features.</span></p><p>For a village, sketch out the roads, including trade routes leading beyond the village and roads that connect outlying farms to the village center. Note the location of the village center. If the adventurers visit specific places in the village, mark those spots on<span class=\"No-Break\"> your map.</span></p><p>For towns and cities, note major roads and waterways as well as surrounding terrain. Outline the walls and mark the locations of features you know will be important: the lord’s keep, significant temples, and the like. For cities, add internal walls and think about the personality of each ward. Give the wards names reflecting their personalities, which also identify the kinds of trades that dominate the neighborhood (Tannery Square, Temple Row), a geographical characteristic (Hilltop, Riverside), or a dominant site (the Lords’<span class=\"No-Break\"> Quarter).</span></p><h2>Urban Encounters</h2><p>Although they hold the promise of safety, cities and towns can be just as dangerous as the darkest dungeon. Evil hides in plain sight or in dark corners. Sewers, shadowy alleys, slums, smoke-filled taverns, dilapidated tenements, and crowded marketplaces can quickly turn into battlegrounds. On top of that, adventurers must learn to behave themselves, lest they attract unwanted attention from local au<span class=\"No-Break\">thorities.</span></p><p>That said, characters who don’t go looking for trouble can take advantage of all the benefits that a settlement has<span class=\"No-Break\"> to offer.</span></p><h3>Law and Order</h3><p>Whether a settlement has a police force depends on its size and nature. A lawful, orderly city might have a city watch to maintain order and a trained militia to defend its walls, and a frontier town might rely on adventurers or its citizenry to apprehend criminals and fend off <span class=\"No-Break\">attackers.</span></p><h4>Trials</h4><p>In most settlements, trials are overseen by magistrates or local lords. Some trials are argued, with the conflicting parties or their advocates presenting precedent and evidence until the judge makes a decision, with or without the aid of spells or interrogation. Others are decided with a trial by ordeal or trial by combat. If the evidence against the accused is overwhelming, a magistrate or local lord can forgo a trial and skip right to the s<span class=\"No-Break\">entencing.</span></p><h4>Sentences</h4><p>A settlement might have a jail to hold accused criminals awaiting trial, but few settlements have prisons to incarcerate convicted criminals. A person found guilty of a crime is usually fined, condemned to forced labor for a period of several months or years, exiled, or executed, depending on the magnitude of <span class=\"No-Break\">the crime.</span></p><h3>Random Urban Encounters</h3><p>The Random Urban Encounters table is useful for city- and town-based adventures. Check for a random encounter at least once per day, and once at night if the characters are out and about. Reroll the result if it doesn’t make sense given the ti<span class=\"No-Break\">me of day.</span></p><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"166421000\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[vTNMOqUAS2YQeSJl]{Encounter}</span></div></div></div><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Animals on the Loose.</span></strong> The characters see one or more unexpected animals loose in the street.

For a creature without a swimming speed, each hour spent swimming at a depth greater than 100 feet counts as 2 hours for the purpose of determining <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a>. Swimming for an hour at a depth greater than 200 feet counts a<span class=\"No-Break\">s 4 hours.</span></p><h4>Underwater Visibility</h4><p>Visibility underwater depends on water clarity and the available light.

A fully crewed sailing vessel can sail all day, assuming its sailors work <span class=\"No-Break\">in shifts.</span></p><h4>Navigation</h4><p>Seagoing vessels stay close to shore when they can, because navigation is easier when landmarks are visible. As long as a ship is within sight of land, there is no chance of the vessel becoming lost. Otherwise, a ship’s navigator must rely on dead reckoning (tracking the direction and distance of the ship’s travel) or the sun and <span class=\"No-Break\">the stars.</span></p><p>Use the Wilderness Navigation table earlier in this chapter&nbsp;to determine whether a ship veers o<span class=\"No-Break\">ff course.</span></p><h4>Random Encounters at Sea</h4><p>You can check for random encounters at sea as often as you would check for them on land (see <a title=\"Creating Adventures\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-adventures\">chapter 3</a>&nbsp;for more information). The Random Encounters at Sea table presents a number of options <span class=\"No-Break\">and ideas.</span></p><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-2109895394\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[GUzHHrlr0ajNA0mF]{Encounter}</span></div></div></div><blockquote>\n<p><strong>SHIPWRECKS</strong></p>\n<p>A shipwreck is a plot device that can be used sparingly to great effect, particularly if you want the characters to be washed ashore on some monster-infested island or (in the case of an airship) dropped in the middle of some exotic land. There aren’t rules for determining when a shipwreck happens; it happens when you want or need it <span class=\"No-Break\">to happen.</span></p>\n<p>Even the strongest seafaring ship can founder in a storm, run aground on rocks or reefs, sink during a pirate attack, or be dragged underwater by a sea monster. A storm or hungry dragon can lay waste to an airship just as easily. A shipwreck has the potential to change the direction of a campaign. It isn’t, however, a particularly good way to kill off characters or end a<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p>\n<p>If you and your campaign conspire to wreck a ship on which the characters are traveling, it is assumed that the characters survive with the equipment they were wearing or carrying still in their possession. The fate of any NPCs and cargo aboard the wrecked ship is entirely <span class=\"No-Break\">up to you.</span></p>\n</blockquote><h4>Weather at Sea</h4><p>Use the Weather table earlier in this chapter&nbsp;when checking for weath<span class=\"No-Break\">er at sea.</span></p><p>If weather conditions indicate both a strong wind and heavy rain, they combine to create a storm with high waves. A crew caught in a storm loses sight of all landmarks (unless there’s a lighthouse or other bright feature), and ability checks made to navigate during the storm have dis<span class=\"No-Break\">advantage.</span></p><p>In a dead calm (no wind), ships can’t move under sail and must be rowed. A ship sailing against a strong wind moves at h<span class=\"No-Break\">alf speed.</span></p><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/854/c5-11.png\"></span></p><h4>Visibility</h4><p>A relatively calm sea offers great visibility. From a crow’s nest, a lookout can spot another ship or a coastline up to 10 miles away, assuming clear skies. Overcast skies reduce that distance by half. Rain and fog reduce visibility just as they d<span class=\"No-Break\">o on land.</span></p><h4>Owning a Ship</h4><p>At some point in your campaign, the adventurers might gain custody of a ship. They might purchase or capture one or receive one to carry out a mission. It’s up to you whether a ship is available for purchase, and you have the power to deprive the adventurers of a ship at any time should it become a nuisance (see the “Shipwrecks”<span class=\"No-Break\"> sidebar).</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Crew.</span></strong> A ship needs a crew of skilled hirelings to function. As per the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em>, one skilled hireling costs at least 2 gp per day. The minimum number of skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on the type of vessel, as shown in the Airborne and Waterborne Vehic<span class=\"No-Break\">les table.</span></p><p>You can track the loyalty of individual crew members or the crew as a whole using the optional loyalty rules in <a title=\"Creating Nonplayer Characters\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters\">chapter 4</a>. If at least half the crew becomes disloyal during a voyage, the crew turns hostile and stages a mutiny. If the ship is berthed, disloyal crew members leave the ship and nev<span class=\"No-Break\">er return.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Passengers. </span></strong>The table indicates the number of Small and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate. Accommodations consist of shared hammocks in tight quarters. A ship outfitted with private accommodations can carry one-fifth as many p<span class=\"No-Break\">assengers.</span></p><p>A passenger is usually expected to pay 5 sp per day for a hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private cabin usually costs 2 g<span class=\"No-Break\">p per day.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Cargo. </span></strong>The table indicates the maximum tonnage each kind of ship <span class=\"No-Break\">can carry.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Damage Threshold.</span></strong> A ship has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn’t reduce the ship’s h<span class=\"No-Break\">it points.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Ship Repair. </span></strong>Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 hit point of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 gp for materials <span class=\"No-Break\">and labor.</span></p><h5>Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles</h5><div>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Ship</th>\n<th>Cost</th>\n<th>Speed</th>\n<th class=\"environments-vehicles-header\">Crew</th>\n<th>Passen<br>-gers</th>\n<th class=\"environments-vehicles-header\">Cargo (tons)</th>\n<th class=\"environments-vehicles-header\">AC</th>\n<th class=\"environments-vehicles-header\">HP</th>\n<th>Damage Threshold</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Airship</td>\n<td>20,000 gp</td>\n<td>8 mph</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>300</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Galley</td>\n<td>30,000 gp</td>\n<td>4 mph</td>\n<td>80</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>150</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Keelboat</td>\n<td>3,000 gp</td>\n<td>1 mph</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1/2</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Longship</td>\n<td>10,000 gp</td>\n<td>3 mph</td>\n<td>40</td>\n<td>150</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>300</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rowboat</td>\n<td>50 gp</td>\n<td>1½ mph</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>50</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sailing ship</td>\n<td>10,000 gp</td>\n<td>2 mph</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>300</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Warship</td>\n<td>25,000 gp</td>\n<td>2½ mph</td>\n<td>60</td>\n<td>60</td>\n<td>200</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n</div><h3>The Sky</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/855/c5-12.png\"></p><p>Flying characters can move from one place to another in a relatively straight line, ignoring terrain and monsters that can’t fly or that lack range<span class=\"No-Break\">d attacks.</span></p><p>Flying by spell or magic item works the same as travel on foot, as described in the <span class=\"italic\"><em>Player’s Handbook</em>.</span> A creature that serves as a flying mount must rest 1 hour for every 3 hours it flies, and it can’t fly for more than 9 hours per day. Thus, characters mounted on griffons (which have a flying speed of 80 feet) can travel at 8 miles per hour, covering 72 miles over 9 hours with two 1-hour-long rests over the course of the day. Mounts that don’t tire (such as a flying construct) aren’t subject to this l<span class=\"No-Break\">imitation.</span></p><p>As adventurers travel through the air, check for random encounters as you normally would. Ignore any result that indicates a non-flying monster, unless the characters are flying close enough to the ground to be targeted by non-flying creatures making ranged attacks. Characters have normal chances to spot creatures on the ground and can decide whether to en<span class=\"No-Break\">gage them.</span></p><h2>Traps</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/856/c5-13.png\"></p><p>Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In the D&amp;D game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poiso<span class=\"No-Break\">ned darts</span><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><p>A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature. <strong><span class=\"bold\">Mechanical traps</span></strong> include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on <span class=\"No-Break\">a mechanism to operate. </span><strong><span class=\"bold\">Magic traps</span></strong> are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells<span class=\"No-Break\"> such as </span><span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/glyph-of-warding\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"glyph of warding\">glyph of warding</a></span><span class=\"No-Break\"> and </span><span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/symbol\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"symbol\">symbol</a></span> that function <span class=\"No-Break\">as traps</span><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><h3>Traps in Play</h3><p>When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or<span class=\"No-Break\"> avoid it.</span></p><h4>Triggering a Trap</h4><p>Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap’s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/glyph-of-warding\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"glyph of warding\">glyph of warding</a> </span>spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from a<span class=\"No-Break\">ctivating.</span></p><h4>Detecting and Disabling a Trap</h4><p>Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap’s<span class=\"No-Break\"> presence.</span></p><p>A trap’s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character’s passive Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\">Investigation</a>) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to perform the necessary<span class=\"No-Break\"> sabotage.</span></p><p>Any character can attempt an Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Arcana\">Arcana</a>) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dispel magic\">dispel magic</a></span> has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap’s description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dispel magic\">dispel magic</a></span><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><p>In most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap’s description to determine what happens. No trap’s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters migh<span class=\"No-Break\">t attempt.</span></p><p>You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is<span class=\"No-Break\"> required.</span></p><p>Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into t<span class=\"No-Break\">he shield.</span></p><p>Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around<span class=\"No-Break\"> the trap.</span></p><h4>Trap Effects</h4><p>The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap’s description specifies what happens when it is <span class=\"No-Break\">triggered.</span></p><p>The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap’s severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap<span class=\"No-Break\"> severity.</span></p><p>A trap intended to be a <strong><span class=\"bold\">setback</span></strong> is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a <strong><span class=\"bold\">dangerous</span></strong> trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels. A <strong><span class=\"bold\">deadly</span></strong> trap is likely to kill characters of the indicat<span class=\"No-Break\">ed levels.</span></p><h5>Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-2128016321\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[kAO8XbpKGpssnSIc]{Trap Danger: Save DC}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-2128016320\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[lCBBGwfkDRnI4hbh]{Trap Danger: Attack Bonus}</span></div></div></div><h5>Damage Severity by Level</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"857446390\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[DNY9l4djdMWnbM8h]{Character Level: Setback}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"857446391\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[b6oeb7kWZsxY34I8]{Character Level: Dangerous}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"857446392\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[34ygGgNPLzuHK3xW]{Character Level: Deadly}</span></div></div></div><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/857/c5-14.png\"></p><h4>Complex Traps</h4><p>Complex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat <span class=\"No-Break\">encounter.</span></p><p>When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap’s description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and disabled or bypassed in the u<span class=\"No-Break\">sual ways.</span></p><p>For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap’s turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completel<span class=\"No-Break\">y flooded.</span></p><h3>Sample Traps</h3><p>The magical and mechanical traps presented here vary in deadliness and are presented in alphabeti<span class=\"No-Break\">cal order.</span></p><h4>Collapsing Roof</h4><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>This trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable section of a ceiling<span class=\"No-Break\"> in place.</span></p><p>The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap<span class=\"No-Break\"> triggers.</span></p><p>Anyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap t<span class=\"No-Break\">o trigger.</span></p><p>The ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and anyone who can see it can tell that it’s in danger of<span class=\"No-Break\"> collapse.</span></p><p>When the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes difficul<span class=\"No-Break\">t terrain.</span></p><h4>Falling Net</h4><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>This trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from th<span class=\"No-Break\">e ceiling.</span></p><p>The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap<span class=\"No-Break\"> triggers.</span></p><p>When the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained\">restrained</a>, and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a>. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in tha<span class=\"No-Break\">t section.</span></p><h4>Fire-Breathing Statue</h4><p><em>Magic trap</em></p><p>This trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard castin<span class=\"No-Break\">g a spell.</span></p><p>The DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"detect magic\">detect magic</a></span>, reveals an aura of evocation magic around t<span class=\"No-Break\">he statue.</span></p><p>The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a succe<span class=\"No-Break\">ssful one.</span></p><p>Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A successful <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dispel magic\">dispel magic</a></span> (DC 13) cast on the statue destroys<span class=\"No-Break\"> the trap.</span></p><h4>Pits</h4><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>Four basic pit traps are prese<span class=\"No-Break\">nted here.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Simple Pit.</span></strong> A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit’s edge and camouflaged with dirt a<span class=\"No-Break\">nd debris.</span></p><p>The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit’s depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits ar<span class=\"No-Break\">e deeper).</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Hidden Pit</span>.</strong> This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor <span class=\"No-Break\">around it.</span></p><p>A successful DC 15 Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit’s cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\">Investigation</a>) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover<span class=\"No-Break\"> of a pit.</span></p><p>When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can <span class=\"No-Break\">be deeper.</span></p><p>Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit’s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/arcane-lock\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"arcane lock\">arcane lock</a></span> spell or simi<span class=\"No-Break\">lar magic.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Locking Pit.</span></strong> This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its vict<span class=\"No-Break\">im inside.</span></p><p>A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open (determine the cover’s statistics using the guidelines in <a title=\"Running the Game\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/running-the-game\">chapter 8</a>). A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) open<span class=\"No-Break\">s the pit.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Spiked Pit.</span></strong> This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a succe<span class=\"No-Break\">ssful one.</span></p><h4>Poison Darts</h4><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>When a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to its own set<span class=\"No-Break\"> of darts.</span></p><p>The tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\">Investigation</a>) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within from <span class=\"No-Break\">launching.</span></p><p>The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8 bonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in the area, the darts don’t hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a succe<span class=\"No-Break\">ssful one.</span></p><h4>Poison Needle</h4><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest’s lock, or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose <span class=\"No-Break\">of poison.</span></p><p>When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Poisoned\">poisoned</a> f<span class=\"No-Break\">or 1 hour.</span></p><p>A successful DC 20 Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\">Investigation</a>) check allows a character to deduce the trap’s presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers<span class=\"No-Break\"> the trap.</span></p><h4>Rolling Sphere</h4><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap’s pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of so<span class=\"No-Break\">lid stone.</span></p><p>With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) check, a character can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\">Investigation</a>) check reveals variations in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate’s presence. The same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from a<span class=\"No-Break\">ctivating.</span></p><p>Activation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures’ spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature’s space or a creature enters its space while it’s rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knoc<span class=\"No-Break\">ked <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a>.</span></p><p>The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can’t go around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to ke<span class=\"No-Break\">ep moving.</span></p><p>As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere’s speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere’s speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer<span class=\"No-Break\"> a threat.</span></p><h4>Sphere of Annihilation</h4><p><em>Magic trap</em></p><p>Magical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter that enters it is instantly ob<span class=\"No-Break\">literated.</span></p><p>A successful DC 20 Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Arcana\">Arcana</a>) check reveals that the mouth contains a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/sphere-of-annihilation\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"sphere of annihilation\">sphere of annihilation</a></span> that can’t be controlled or moved. It is otherwise identical to a normal <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/sphere-of-annihilation\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"sphere of annihilation\">sphere of annihilation</a></span>, as described in chapter 7, \"<a title=\"Treasure\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/treasure\">Treasure</a><span class=\"No-Break\">.\"</span></p><p>Some versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the <span class=\"italic\">sympathy</span> aspect of the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antipathy-sympathy\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"antipathy/sympathy\">antipathy/sympathy</a></span> spell. A successful <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dispel magic\">dispel magic</a></span> (DC 18) removes this en<span class=\"No-Break\">chantment.</span></p>","img":null,"_id":"2tbtL6COfDt1PCir"}
{"name":" 07 Chapter 6: Between Adventures","permission":{"default":0,"DJNYgTCLxATVgLjS":3},"flags":{"vtta":{"name":"07 Chapter 6: Between Adventures","sceneId":null}},"content":"<h1>Chapter 6: Between Adventures</h1><p>A campaign is much more than a series of adventures. It also includes the moments between them — the various distractions and side pursuits that engage the characters when they’re not exploring the wilderness, plundering dungeons, and gallivanting around the multiverse on some epic quest.</p><p>The natural pace of a campaign offers lulls between adventures, time for the characters to spend their treasure and pursue their goals. This downtime gives the characters an opportunity to sink their roots a little deeper into the world, building a personal investment in what happens to the people and places around them, which can, in turn, draw them into further adventures.</p><p>Chapter 5, \"<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>\"&nbsp;of the <em>Player’s Handbook</em> details the expenses that a character incurs for basic necessities, depending on the lifestyle the character chooses, from poverty to luxury. Chapter 8, \"<a title=\"Adventuring\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring\">Adventuring</a>\" of the <em>Player's Handbook</em> describes some of the downtime activities they can pursue between adventures. This chapter fills in the gaps, describing the expenses of owning property and hiring NPCs, and a variety of additional downtime activities characters can pursue. The beginning of the chapter also offers suggestions for linking adventures together and keeping track of events in your campaign.</p><h2>Linking Adventures</h2><p>A campaign in the style of an episodic television show rarely needs story links between its adventures. Each adventure features its own villains, and once the characters complete the adventure, there are typically no loose plot threads. The next adventure presents an altogether different challenge having nothing to do with the adventure that preceded it. As the characters gain experience points, they become more powerful, as do the threats they must overcome. This kind of campaign is easy to run, since it requires little effort beyond finding or creating adventures appropriate for the part<span class=\"No-Break\">y’s level.</span></p><p>A campaign with a narrative lets the players feel as though their actions have far-reaching consequences. They’re not just racking up experience points. A few simple modifications can help you overlay overarching elements to create a serialized campaign in which early adventures help set up l<span class=\"No-Break\">ater ones.</span></p><h2>Using an Overarching Story</h2><p>This section presents a couple of examples of overarching stories which have, over the years, fueled many classic D&amp;D <span class=\"No-Break\">campaigns.</span></p><p>The adventurers’ goal in the first example is to amass the power they need to defeat a powerful enemy that threatens the world. Their goal in the second example is to defend something they care about by destroying whatever threatens it. The two examples are, in effect, the same story (variations of the battle between good and evil) told in diffe<span class=\"No-Break\">rent ways.</span></p><h4>Example 1: The Quest of Many Parts</h4><p>You can tie adventures together using an overarching goal that can be fulfilled only by first completing a series of related quests. For example, you could create a villain who can’t be defeated until the characters explore nine dungeons in which the Nine Dread Princes reside, with each of these dungeons stocked with enough monsters and hazards to advance the adventurers two or three levels. The adventurers spend their whole careers fighting the Nine Dread Princes before finally pursuing an epic quest to destroy the princes’ monstrous progenitor. As long as every dungeon is unique and interesting, your players will appreciate the tight focus of the<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><p>In a similar type of quest campaign, the adventurers might need to collect fragments of an artifact that are scattered in ruins across the multiverse, before reassembling the artifact and using it to defeat a cosm<span class=\"No-Break\">ic threat.</span></p><h4>Example 2: Agents of X</h4><p>You can also build a campaign around the idea that the adventurers are agents of something larger than themselves — a kingdom or secret organization, for example. Wherever their allegiance lies, the adventurers are motivated by loyalty and the goal of protecting whatever it is t<span class=\"No-Break\">hey serve.</span></p><p>The characters’ overarching mission might be to explore and map an uncharted region, forging alliances where they can and overcoming threats they encounter along the way. Their goal might be to find the ancient capital of a fallen empire, which lies beyond the realm of a known enemy and forces them to navigate hostile territory. The characters could be pilgrims in search of a holy site or members of a secret order dedicated to defending the last bastions of civilization in an ever-declining world. Or they might be spies and assassins, striving to weaken an enemy country by targeting its evil leaders and plundering its <span class=\"No-Break\">treasures.</span></p><h2>Planting Adventure Seeds</h2><p>You can make a campaign feel like one story with many chapters by planting the seeds of the next adventure before the current one is finished. This technique can naturally moves the characters along to their <span class=\"No-Break\">next goal.</span></p><p>If you’ve planted a seed well, the characters have something else to do when they finish an adventure. Perhaps a character drinks from a magic fountain in a dungeon and receives a mystifying vision that leads to the next quest. The party might find a cryptic map or relic that, once its meaning or purpose is determined, points to a new destination. Perhaps an NPC warns the characters of impending danger or implores them<span class=\"No-Break\"> for help.</span></p><p>The trick is to not distract the characters from the adventure at hand. Designing an effective hook for a future adventure requires finesse. The lure should be compelling, but not so irresistible that the players stop caring about what their characters are doing <span class=\"No-Break\">right now.</span></p><p>To keep players from straying, save your best ideas for the very end of your adventures, or insert them during periods of<span class=\"No-Break\"> downtime.</span></p><p>Here are a few examples of ways in which an adventure seed can be<span class=\"No-Break\"> revealed:</span></p><ul>\n<li>On a villain’s corpse, the characters find evidence that the villain was working for som<span class=\"No-Break\">eone else.</span></li>\n<li>A captured NPC reveals the location of someone or something that might interest the c<span class=\"No-Break\">haracters.</span></li>\n<li>The characters are heading to a local tavern when they spot a wanted poster or a missing person poster (complete with the promise of a sizabl<span class=\"No-Break\">e reward).</span></li>\n<li>Members of the local militia or city watch put out the word that a crime has been committed, and they’re looking for potential witnesses and<span class=\"No-Break\"> suspects.</span></li>\n<li>The characters receive an anonymous letter that sheds light on a plot or impending event of which they were previousl<span class=\"No-Break\">y unaware.</span></li>\n</ul><h2>Foreshadowing</h2><p>Foreshadowing is an exercise in subtlety, involving the delicate planting of seeds for future adventures. Not all foreshadowing bears fruit, particularly if the clues are too subtle or if events conspire to take your campaign in a new direction. The goal of foreshadowing is to hint at upcoming events and new threats in your campaign without making it obvious to players that you’re telling them what the future holds. Here are a few<span class=\"No-Break\"> examples:</span></p><ul>\n<li>An object worn or carried by an enemy has the symbol of a previously unknown organization engraved or writ<span class=\"No-Break\">ten on it.</span></li>\n<li>A mad woman standing on a street corner spouts fragments of an ancient prophecy, while pointing a crooked finger at the c<span class=\"No-Break\">haracters.</span></li>\n<li>The king and queen announce the marriage of their son to the daughter of a neighboring monarch, but various factions oppose the union. Trouble i<span class=\"No-Break\">s brewing.</span></li>\n<li>Bugbear scouts are making incursions into civilized lands and spying on settlements, as a prelude to a hobgoblin warlord’s<span class=\"No-Break\"> invasion.</span></li>\n<li>A puppet show in a market square predicts a tragic outcome if two noble houses on the cusp of declaring war on each other refuse to <span class=\"No-Break\">reconcile.</span></li>\n<li>NPC adventurers in a city are being murdered in a similar yet unusual manner, hinting at a future threat to the player c<span class=\"No-Break\">haracters.</span></li>\n</ul><h2>Campaign Tracking</h2><p>Consistent details bring your campaign to life, and continuity helps players imagine that their characters are living in a real world. If the adventurers frequent a particular tavern, the staff, layout of the building, and decor shouldn’t change much from one visit to the next. That said, changes can occur as a result of the characters’ actions or of actions they learn about. When the adventurers kill a monster, it stays dead, unless someone raises it. When they remove treasure from a room, it doesn’t reappear the next time they enter — assuming it hasn’t been stolen from them! If they leave a door open, it should stay open until someone <span class=\"No-Break\">closes it.</span></p><p>No one’s memory is infallible, so it pays to keep records. Jot notes directly on an adventure map to keep track of open doors, disarmed traps, and the like. Events beyond the scope of a single adventure are best recorded in a notebook dedicated to your campaign. Whether it’s a physical book or an electronic file, such a record is a great way to keep your notes <span class=\"No-Break\">organized.</span></p><p>Your notebook might include any of the following<span class=\"No-Break\"> elements.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"> Campaign Planner.</span></strong> Write down the main story arc of your campaign, and keep track of things that you hope appear in future adventures. Update it as the campaign develops, adding ideas as they co<span class=\"No-Break\">me to you.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"> Character Notes.</span></strong> Write down the characters’ backgrounds and goals, since these notes can help you design adventure content that provides opportunities for character de<span class=\"No-Break\">velopment.</span></p><p>Keep a running tally of the adventurers’ classes and levels, as well as any quests and downtime activities they’re e<span class=\"No-Break\">ngaged in.</span></p><p>If the characters have a ship or stronghold, record its name and whereabouts, as well as any hirelings in the character<span class=\"No-Break\">s’ employ.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"> Player Handouts.</span></strong> Keep a copy of all handouts you make for your players so that you don’t have to remember their conte<span class=\"No-Break\">nts later.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"> Adventure Log.</span></strong> Think of this log as an episode guide for your campaign. Summarize each game session or adventure to help you keep track of the unfolding campaign story. You can give your players access to this log as well, or to an edited version stripped of your notes and secrets. (The players might also keep their own record of adventures, which you can refer to if your own log is in<span class=\"No-Break\">complete.)</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"> NPC Notes.</span></strong> Record statistics and roleplaying notes for any NPC the characters interact with more than once. For example, your notes might differentiate important people in a town by their different voices, as well as their names, the places where they live and work, the names of their family members and associates, and maybe even a secret that each one of<span class=\"No-Break\"> them has.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"> Campaign Calendar.</span></strong> Your world feels more real to your players when the characters notice the passage of time. Note details such as the change of seasons and major holidays, and keep track of any important events that affect the lar<span class=\"No-Break\">ger story.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"> Toolbox.</span></strong> Keep notes whenever you create or significantly alter a monster, magic item, or trap. Keep any maps, random dungeons, or encounters you create. This information ensures you won’t repeat your work, and you’ll be able to draw on this mater<span class=\"No-Break\">ial later.</span></p><h2>Recurring Expenses</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/861/c6-02.png\"></p><p>Besides the expenses associated with maintaining a particular lifestyle, adventurers might have additional drains on their adventuring income. Player characters who come into possession of property, own businesses, and employ hirelings must cover the expenses that accompany these<span class=\"No-Break\"> ventures.</span></p><p>It’s not unusual for adventurers — especially after 10th level — to gain possession of a castle, a tavern, or another piece of property. They might buy it with their hard-won loot, take it by force, obtain it in a lucky draw from a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/deck-of-many-things\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"deck of many things\">deck of many things</a></span>, or acquire it by ot<span class=\"No-Break\">her means.</span></p><p>The Maintenance Costs table shows the per-day upkeep cost for any such property. (The cost of a normal residence isn’t included here because it falls under lifestyle expenses, as discussed in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em>.) Maintenance expenses need to be paid every 30 days. Given that adventurers spend much of their time adventuring, staff includes a steward who can make payments in the party’<span class=\"No-Break\">s absence.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Total Cost per Day.</span></strong> The cost includes everything it takes to maintain the property and keep things running smoothly, including the salaries of hirelings.

However, the owner needs to periodically ensure that everything is running smoothly by tending to the business between adventures. See the information on running a business in “<a title=\"Downtime Activities\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/between-adventures#DowntimeActivites\">Downtime Activities</a>” in thi<span class=\"No-Break\">s chapter.</span></p><h4>Garrisons</h4><p>Castles and keeps employ soldiers (use the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/veteran\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"veteran\">veteran</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/guard\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"guard\">guard</a> statistics in the <em><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/mm/nonplayer-characters\">Monster Manual</a></em>) to defend them.

These armed warriors make up the bulk of a property’s skilled hirelings.</p><h2>Downtime Activities</h2><p>The campaign benefits when characters have time between adventures to engage in other activities. Allowing days, weeks, or months to pass between adventures stretches the campaign over a longer period of time and helps to manage the characters’ level progression, preventing them from gaining too much power to<span class=\"No-Break\">o quickly.</span></p><p>Allowing characters to pursue side interests between adventures also encourages players to become more invested in the campaign world. When a character owns a tavern in a village or spends time carousing with the locals, that character’s player is more likely to respond to threats to the village and its in<span class=\"No-Break\">habitants.</span></p><p>As your campaign progresses, your players’ characters will not only become more powerful but also more influential and invested in the world. They might be inclined to undertake projects that require more time between adventures, such as building and maintaining a stronghold. As the party gains levels, you can add more downtime between adventures to give characters the time they need to pursue such interests. Whereas days or weeks might pass between low-level adventures, the amount of downtime between higher-level adventures might be measured in months<span class=\"No-Break\"> or years.</span></p><h3>More Downtime Activities</h3><p>Chapter 8, \"<a title=\"Adventuring\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring\">Adventuring</a>\"&nbsp;of the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em> describes a few downtime activities to fill the void between adventures. Depending on the style of your campaign and the particular backgrounds and interests of the adventurers, you can make some or all of the following additional activities available a<span class=\"No-Break\">s options.</span></p><h4>Building a Stronghold</h4><p>A character can spend time between adventures building a stronghold. Before work can begin, the character must acquire a plot of land. If the estate lies within a kingdom or similar domain, the character will need a royal charter (a legal document granting permission to oversee the estate in the name of the crown), a land grant (a legal document bequeathing custody of the land to the character for as long as he or she remains loyal to the crown), or a deed (a legal document that serves as proof of ownership). Land can also be acquired by inheritance or ot<span class=\"No-Break\">her means.</span></p><p>Royal charters and land grants are usually given by the crown as a reward for faithful service, although they can also be bought. Deeds can be bought or inherited. A small estate might sell for as little as 100 gp or as much as 1,000 gp. A large estate might cost 5,000 gp or more, if it can be boug<span class=\"No-Break\">ht at all.</span></p><p>Once the estate is secured, a character needs access to building materials and laborers. The Building a Stronghold table shows the cost of building the stronghold (including materials and labor) and the amount of time it takes, provided that the character is using downtime to oversee construction. Work can continue while the character is away, but each day the character is away adds 3 days to the construc<span class=\"No-Break\">tion time.</span></p><h5>Building a Stronghold</h5><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\"><br>Stronghold</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Construction Cost</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Construction Time</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Abbey</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">50,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">400 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Guildhall, town or city</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">5,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">60 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Keep or small castle</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">50,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">400 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Noble estate with manor</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">25,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">150 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Outpost or fort</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">15,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">100 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Palace or large castle</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">500,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1,200 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Temple</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">50,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">400 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Tower, fortified</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">15,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">100 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Trading post</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">5,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">60 days</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/862/c6-03.png\"></p><h4>Carousing</h4><p>Characters can spend their downtime engaged in a variety of hedonistic activities such as attending parties, binge drinking, gambling, or anything else that helps them cope with the perils they face on their a<span class=\"No-Break\">dventures.</span></p><p>A carousing character spends money as though maintaining a wealthy lifestyle (see chapter 5, “<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>,” in&nbsp;the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em>). At the end of the period spent carousing, the player rolls percentile dice and adds the character’s level, then compares the total to the Carousing table to determine what happens to the character, or y<span class=\"No-Break\">ou choose.</span></p><h5>Carousing</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1827583191\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[t6WUJDDRocv290Vf]{Result}</span></div></div></div><h4>Crafting a Magic Item</h4><p>Magic items are the DM’s purview, so you decide how they fall into the party’s possession. As an option, you can allow player characters to craft ma<span class=\"No-Break\">gic items.</span></p><p>The creation of a magic item is a lengthy, expensive task. To start, a character must have a formula that describes the construction of the item. The character must also be a spellcaster with spell slots and must be able to cast any spells that the item can produce. Moreover, the character must meet a level minimum determined by the item’s rarity, as shown in the Crafting Magic Items table. For example, a 3rd-level character could create a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/wand-of-magic-missiles\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"wand of magic missiles\">wand of magic missiles</a></span> (an uncommon item), as long as the character has spell slots and can cast <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"magic missile\">magic missile</a></span>. That same character could make a <span class=\"italic\">+1 weapon</span> (another uncommon item), no particular spell<span class=\"No-Break\"> required.</span></p><p>You can decide that certain items also require special materials or locations to be created. For example, a character might need alchemist’s supplies to brew a particular potion, or the formula for a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/flame-tongue\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"flame tongue\">flame tongue</a></span> might require that the weapon be forged <span class=\"No-Break\">with lava.</span></p><h5>Crafting Magic Items</h5><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Item Rarity</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Creation Cost</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Minimum Level</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Common</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">100 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Uncommon</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">500 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Rare</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">5,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">6th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Very rare</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">50,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">11th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Legendary</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">500,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">17th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p>An item has a creation cost specified in the Crafting Magic Items table (half that cost for a consumable, such as a potion or scroll). A character engaged in the crafting of a magic item makes progress in 25 gp increments, spending that amount for each day of work until the total cost is paid. The character is assumed to work for 8 hours each of those days. Thus, creating an uncommon magic item takes 20 days and 500 gp. You are free to adjust the costs to better suit your campaign.</p><p>If a spell will be produced by the item being created, the creator must expend one spell slot of the spell’s level for each day of the creation process. The spell’s material components must also be at hand throughout the process. If the spell normally consumes those components, they are consumed by the creation process. If the item will be able to produce the spell only once, as with a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/spell-scroll\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"spell scroll\">spell scroll</a>, the components are consumed only once by the process. Otherwise, the components are consumed once each day of the item’s<span class=\"No-Break\"> creation.</span></p><p>Multiple characters can combine their efforts to create a magic item if each of them meets the level prerequisite. Each character can contribute spells, spell slots, and components, as long as everyone participates during the entire crafting process. Each character can contribute 25 gp worth of effort for each day spent helping to craft<span class=\"No-Break\"> the item.</span></p><p>Normally, a character who undertakes this activity creates a magic item described in chapter 7, \"<a title=\"Treasure\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/treasure\">Treasure</a>.\" At your discretion, you can allow players to design their own magic items, using the guidelines in chapter 9, \"<a title=\"Dungeon Master's Workshop\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop\">Dungeon Master’s </a><span class=\"No-Break\"><a title=\"Dungeon Master's Workshop\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop\">Workshop</a>.\"</span></p><p>While crafting a magic item, a character can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay the 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5, “<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>,” in&nbsp;the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em><span class=\"No-Break\">).</span></p><h4>Gaining Renown</h4><p>A character can spend downtime improving his or her renown within a particular organization (see “Renown” in <a title=\"A World of Your Own\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/a-world-of-your-own\">chapter 1</a>). Between adventures, a character undertakes minor tasks for the organization and socializes with its members. After pursuing these activities for a combined number of days equal to his or her current renown multiplied by 10, the character’s renown incre<span class=\"No-Break\">ases by 1.</span></p><h4>Performing Sacred Rites</h4><p>A pious character can spend time between adventures performing sacred rites in a temple affiliated with a god he or she reveres. Between rites, the character spends time in meditation a<span class=\"No-Break\">nd prayer.</span></p><p>A character who is a priest in the temple can lead these rites, which might include weddings, funerals, and ordinations. A layperson can offer sacrifices in a temple or assist a priest wi<span class=\"No-Break\">th a rite.</span></p><p>A character who spends at least 10 days performing sacred rites gains inspiration (described in <a title=\"Personality and Background\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/personality-and-background\">chapter 4</a>&nbsp;of the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em>) at the start of each day for the next<span class=\"No-Break\"> 2d6 days.</span></p><h4>Running a Business</h4><p>Adventurers can end up owning businesses that have nothing to do with delving into dungeons or saving the world. A character might inherit a smithy, or the party might be given a parcel of farmland or a tavern as a reward. If they hold on to the business, they might feel obliged to spend time between adventures maintaining the venture and making sure it runs<span class=\"No-Break\"> smoothly.</span></p><p>A character rolls percentile dice and adds the number of days spent on this downtime activity (maximum 30), then compares the total to the Running a Business table to determine wha<span class=\"No-Break\">t happens.</span></p><p>If the character is required to pay a cost as a result of rolling on this table but fails to do so, the business begins to fail. For each unpaid debt incurred in this manner, the character takes a −10 penalty to subsequent rolls made on t<span class=\"No-Break\">his table.</span></p><h5>Running a Business</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-62737170\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[ybMvtvCupq6qThzf]{Result}</span></div></div></div><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/863/c6-04.png\"></p><h4>Selling Magic Items</h4><p>Few people can afford to buy a magic item, and fewer still know how to find one. Adventurers are exceptional in this regard due to the nature of their p<span class=\"No-Break\">rofession.</span></p><p>A character who comes into possession of a common, uncommon, rare, or very rare magic item that he or she wants to sell can spend downtime searching for a buyer. This downtime activity can be performed only in a city or another location where one can find wealthy individuals interested in buying magic items. Legendary magic items and priceless artifacts can’t be sold during downtime. Finding someone to buy such an item can be the substance of an adventure<span class=\"No-Break\"> or quest.</span></p><p>For each salable item, the character makes a DC 20 Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\">Investigation</a>) check to find buyers. Another character can use his or her downtime to assist with the search, granting advantage on the checks. On a failed check, no buyer for the item is found after a search that lasts 10 days. On a successful check, a buyer for the item is found after a number of days based on the item’s rarity, as shown in the Salable Magic I<span class=\"No-Break\">tem table.</span></p><p>A character can attempt to find buyers for multiple magic items at once. Although this requires multiple Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\">Investigation</a>) checks, the searches are occurring simultaneously, and the results of multiple failures or successes aren’t added together. For example, if the character finds a buyer for a common magic item in 2 days and a buyer for an uncommon item in 5 days, but fails to find a buyer for a rare item up for grabs, the entire search take<span class=\"No-Break\">s 10 days.</span></p><p>For each item a character wishes to sell, the player rolls percentile dice and consults the Selling a Magic Item table, applying a modifier based on the item’s rarity, as shown in the Salable Magic Items table. The character also makes a Charisma (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Persuasion\">Persuasion</a>) check and adds that check’s total to the roll. The subsequent total determines what a buyer offers to pay for<span class=\"No-Break\"> the item.</span></p><p>You determine a buyer’s identity. Buyers sometimes procure rare and very rare items through proxies to ensure that their identities remain unknown. If the buyer is shady, it’s up to you whether the sale creates legal complications for the pa<span class=\"No-Break\">rty later.</span></p><h5>Salable Magic Items</h5><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Rarity</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Base Price</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Days to<br>Find Buyer</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">d100 Roll<br>Modifier*</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Common</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">100 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1d4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Uncommon</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">500 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1d6</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Rare</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">5,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1d8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">−10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Very rare</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">50,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1d10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">−20</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p>* Apply this modifier to rolls on the Selling a Magic Item table.</p><h5>Selling a Magic Item</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-941504797\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[uBmTb4aykPQEpjP7]{You Find}</span></div></div></div><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/864/c6-05.png\"></p><h4>Sowing Rumors</h4><p>Swaying public opinion can be an effective way to bring down a villain or elevate a friend. Spreading rumors is an efficient, if underhanded, way to accomplish that goal. Well-placed rumors can increase the subject’s standing in a community or embroil someone in scandal. A rumor needs to be simple, concrete, and hard to disprove. An effective rumor also has to be believable, playing off what people want to believe about the person in<span class=\"No-Break\"> question.</span></p><p>Sowing a rumor about an individual or organization requires a number of days depending on the size of the community, as shown in the Sowing Rumors table. In a town or city, the time spent must be continuous. If the character spreads a rumor for ten days, disappears on an adventure for another few days and then returns, the rumor fades away without the benefit of constant r<span class=\"No-Break\">epetition.</span></p><h5>Sowing Rumors</h5><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Settlement Size</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Time Required</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Village</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2d6 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Town</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4d6 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">City</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">6d6 days</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p>The character must spend 1 gp per day to cover the cost of drinks, social appearances, and the like. At the end of the time spent sowing the rumor, the character must make a DC 15 Charisma (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Deception\">Deception</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Persuasion\">Persuasion</a>) check. If the check succeeds, the community’s prevailing attitude toward the subject shifts one step toward friendly or hostile, as the character wishes. If the check fails, the rumor gains no traction, and further attempts to propagat<span class=\"No-Break\">e it fail.</span></p><p>Shifting a community’s general attitude toward a person or organization doesn’t affect everyone in the community. Individuals might hold to their own opinions, particularly if they have personal experience in dealing with the subject of t<span class=\"No-Break\">he rumors.</span></p><h4>Training to Gain Levels</h4><p>As a variant rule, you can require characters to spend downtime training or studying before they gain the benefits of a new level. If you choose this option, once a character has earned enough experience points to attain a new level, he or she must train for a number of days before gaining any class features associated with the <span class=\"No-Break\">new level.</span></p><p>The training time required depends on the level to be gained, as shown on the Training to Gain Levels table. The training cost is for the total trai<span class=\"No-Break\">ning time.</span></p><h5>Training to Gain Levels</h5><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Level Attained</th>\n<th>Training Time</th>\n<th>Training Cost</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd–4th</td>\n<td>10 days</td>\n<td>20 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th–10th</td>\n<td>20 days</td>\n<td>40 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th–16th</td>\n<td>30 days</td>\n<td>60 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th–20th</td>\n<td>40 days</td>\n<td>80 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h3>Creating Downtime Activities</h3><p>Your players might be interested in pursuing downtime activities that aren’t covered in this chapter or in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em>.

Strands of golden chains, stacks of platinum coins, bejeweled crowns, enameled scepters, bolts of silk cloth, and powerful magic items all wait to be seized or unearthed by intrepid, treasure-seeking ad<span class=\"No-Break\">venturers.</span></p><p>This chapter details magic items and the placement of treasure in an adventure, as well as special rewards that can be granted instead of or in addition to magic items and mundane<span class=\"No-Break\"> treasure.</span></p><h2>Types of Treasure</h2><p>Treasure comes in m<span class=\"No-Break\">any forms.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Coins.</span></strong> The most basic type of treasure is money, including copper pieces (cp), silver pieces (sp), electrum pieces (ep), gold pieces (gp), and platinum pieces (pp). Fifty coins of any type weig<span class=\"No-Break\">h 1 pound.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Gemstones.</span></strong> Gemstones are small, lightweight, and easily secured compared to their same value in coins. See the “Gemstones” section for types of stones, gems, and jewels that can be found as<span class=\"No-Break\"> treasure.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Art Objects.</span></strong> Idols cast of solid gold, necklaces studded with precious stones, paintings of ancient kings, bejeweled dishes—art objects include all these and more. See the “Art Objects” section for types of decorative and valuable artworks that can be found as<span class=\"No-Break\"> treasure.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Magic Items.</span></strong> Types of magic items include armor, potions, scrolls, rings, rods, staffs, wands, weapons, and wondrous items. Magic items also have rarities: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and <span class=\"No-Break\">legendary.</span></p><p>Intelligent monsters often use magic items in their possession, while others might hide them away to ensure they don’t get lost or stolen. For example, if a hobgoblin tribe has a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/longsword-1\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"longsword, +1\">longsword, +1</a></span> and an <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/alchemy-jug\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"alchemy jug\">alchemy jug</a></span> in its treasure hoard, the tribe’s warlord might wield the sword, while the jug is kept somew<span class=\"No-Break\">here safe.</span></p><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/3/295/c10appendixa-12.png\"></span></p><h2>Random Treasure</h2><p>The following pages contain tables that you can use to randomly generate treasures carried by monsters, stashed in their lairs, or otherwise hidden away. The placement of treasure is left to your discretion. The key is to make sure the players feel rewarded for playing, and that their characters are rewarded for overcoming dangerous c<span class=\"No-Break\">hallenges.</span></p><h3>Treasure Tables</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/866/c7a-03.png\"></p><p>Treasure can be randomly allocated based on a monster’s challenge rating. There are tables for challenge rating 0–4, challenge rating 5–10, challenge rating 11–16, and challenge rating 17 and higher. Use these tables to randomly determine how much money an individual monster carries (the D&amp;D equivalent of pocket change) or the amount of wealth found in a larger treas<span class=\"No-Break\">ure hoard.</span></p><h4>Using the Individual Treasure Tables</h4><p>An Individual Treasure table helps you randomly determine how much treasure one creature carries on its person. If a monster has no interest in amassing treasure, you can use this table to determine the incidental treasure left behind by the monster’<span class=\"No-Break\">s victims.</span></p><p>Use the Individual Treasure table that corresponds to the monster’s challenge rating. Roll a d100, and read the result across to determine how many coins of each type the monster carries. The table also includes the average result in parentheses, should you wish to forgo another roll and save time. To determine the total amount of individual treasure for a group of similar creatures, you can save time by rolling once and multiplying the result by the number of creatures in <span class=\"No-Break\">the group.</span></p><p>If it doesn’t make sense for a monster to carry a large pile of coins, you can convert the coins into gemstones or art objects of eq<span class=\"No-Break\">ual value.</span></p><h4>Using the Treasure Hoard Tables</h4><p>A Treasure Hoard table helps you randomly determine the contents of a large cache of treasure, the accumulated wealth of a large group of creatures (such as an orc tribe or a hobgoblin army), the belongings of a single powerful creature that likes to hoard treasure (such as a dragon), or the reward bestowed upon a party after completing a quest for a benefactor. You can also split up a treasure hoard so that the adventurers don’t find or receive it al<span class=\"No-Break\">l at once.</span></p><p>When determining the contents of a hoard belonging to one monster, use the table that corresponds to that monster’s challenge rating. When rolling to determine a treasure hoard belonging to a large group of monsters, use the challenge rating of the monster that leads the group. If the hoard belongs to no one, use the challenge rating of the monster that presides over the dungeon or lair you are stocking. If the hoard is a gift from a benefactor, use the challenge rating equal to the party’s aver<span class=\"No-Break\">age level.</span></p><p>Every treasure hoard contains a random number of coins, as shown at the top of each table. Roll a d100 and consult the table to determine how many gemstones or art objects the hoard contains, if any. Use the same roll to determine whether the hoard contains ma<span class=\"No-Break\">gic items.</span></p><p>As with the individual treasure tables, average values are given in parentheses. You can use an average value instead of rolling dice to <span class=\"No-Break\">save time.</span></p><p>If a treasure hoard seems too small, you can roll multiple times on the table. Use this approach for monsters that are particularly fond of amassing treasure. Legendary creatures that accumulate treasure are wealthier than normal. Always roll at least twice on the appropriate table and add the results<span class=\"No-Break\"> together.</span></p><p>You can hand out as much or as little treasure as you want. Over the course of a typical campaign, a party finds treasure hoards amounting to seven rolls on the Challenge 0–4 table, eighteen rolls on the Challenge 5–10 table, twelve rolls on the Challenge 11–16 table, and eight rolls on the Challenge <span class=\"No-Break\">17+ table.</span></p><div>\n<h4 id=\"IndividualTreasureChallenge04\" class=\"quick-menu-exclude\">Individual Treasure: Challenge

Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement their owner’s capabilities in wond<span class=\"No-Break\">rous ways.</span></p><h3>Rarity</h3><p>Each magic item has a rarity: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, or legendary. Common magic items, such as a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-healing\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"potion of healing\">potion of healing</a></span>, are the most plentiful. Some legendary items, such as the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/apparatus-of-kwalish\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"apparatus of Kwalish\">apparatus of Kwalish</a></span>, are unique. The game assumes that the secrets of creating the most powerful items arose centuries ago and were then gradually lost as a result of wars, cataclysms, and mishaps. Even uncommon items can’t be easily created. Thus, many magic items are well-preserved an<span class=\"No-Break\">tiquities.</span></p><p>Rarity provides a rough measure of an item’s power relative to other magic items. Each rarity corresponds to character level, as shown in the Magic Item Rarity table. A character doesn’t typically find a rare magic item, for example, until around 5th level. That said, rarity shouldn’t get in the way of your campaign’s story. If you want a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/ring-of-invisibility\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"ring of invisibility\">ring of invisibility</a></span> to fall into the hands of a 1st-level character, so be it. No doubt a great story will arise from t<span class=\"No-Break\">hat event.</span></p><p>If your campaign allows for trade in magic items, rarity can also help you set prices for them. As the DM, you determine the value of an individual magic item based on its rarity. Suggested values are provided in the Magic Item Rarity table. The value of a consumable item, such as a potion or scroll, is typically half the value of a permanent item of the sa<span class=\"No-Break\">me rarity.</span></p><h4>Magic Item Rarity</h4><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Rarity</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Character Level</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Common</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1st or higher</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">50–100 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Uncommon</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1st or higher</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">101–500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Rare</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">5th or higher</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">501–5,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Very rare</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">11th or higher</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">5,001–50,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Legendary</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">17th or higher</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">50,001+ gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h3>Buying and Selling</h3><p>Unless you decide your campaign works otherwise, most magic items are so rare that they aren’t available for purchase. Common items, such as a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-healing\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"potion of healing\">potion of healing</a></span>, can be procured from an alchemist, herbalist, or spellcaster. Doing so is rarely as simple as walking into a shop and selecting an item from a shelf. The seller might ask for a service, rather <span class=\"No-Break\">than coin.</span></p><p>In a large city with an academy of magic or a major temple, buying and selling magic items might be possible, at your discretion. If your world includes a large number of adventurers engaged in retrieving ancient magic items, trade in these items might be more common. Even so, it’s likely to remain similar to the market for fine art in the real world, with invitation-only auctions and a tendency to attrac<span class=\"No-Break\">t thieves.</span></p><p>Selling magic items is difficult in most D&amp;D worlds primarily because of the challenge of finding a buyer. Plenty of people might like to have a magic sword, but few of them can afford it. Those who can afford such an item usually have more practical things to spend on. See chapter 6, \"<a title=\"Between Adventures\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/between-adventures\">Between Adventures</a>\" for one way to handle selling ma<span class=\"No-Break\">gic items.</span></p><p>In your campaign, magic items might be prevalent enough that adventurers can buy and sell them with some effort. Magic items might be for sale in bazaars or auction houses in fantastical locations, such as the City of Brass, the planar metropolis of Sigil, or even in more ordinary cities. Sale of magic items might be highly regulated, accompanied by a thriving black market. Artificers might craft items for use by military forces or adventurers, as they do in the world of Eberron. You might also allow characters to craft their own magic items, as discussed in <a title=\"Between Adventures\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/between-adventures\">chapter 6</a><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><h3>Identifying a Magic Item</h3><p>Some magic items are indistinguishable from their nonmagical counterparts, whereas other magic items display their magical nature conspicuously. Whatever a magic item’s appearance, handling the item is enough to give a character a sense that something is extraordinary about it. Discovering a magic item’s properties isn’t automatic<span class=\"No-Break\">, however.</span></p><p>The <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"identify\">identify</a></span> spell is the fastest way to reveal an item’s properties. Alternatively, a character can focus on one magic item during a short rest, while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character learns the item’s properties, as well as how to use them. Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the taster what the po<span class=\"No-Break\">tion does.</span></p><p>Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its properties. The command word to activate a ring might be etched in tiny letters inside it, or a feathered design might suggest that it’s a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/ring-of-feather-falling\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"ring of feather falling\">ring of feather falling</a></span><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><p>Wearing or experimenting with an item can also offer hints about its properties. For example, if a character puts on a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/ring-of-jumping\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"ring of jumping\">ring of jumping</a></span>, you could say, “Your steps feel strangely springy.” Perhaps the character then jumps up and down to see what happens. You then say the character jumps unexpect<span class=\"No-Break\">edly high.</span></p><h4>Variant: More Difficult Identification</h4><p>If you prefer magic items to have a greater mystique, consider removing the ability to identify the properties of a magic item during a short rest, and require the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"identify\">identify</a></span> spell, experimentation, or both to reveal what a magic item does.</p><h3>Attunement</h3><p>Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if that monster has spell slots and uses that class’s sp<span class=\"No-Break\">ell list.)</span> If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, not using a magic item or the like.</p><p>Without becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical p<span class=\"No-Break\">roperties.</span></p><p>Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can’t be the same short rest used to learn the item’s properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary comm<span class=\"No-Break\">and words.</span></p><p>An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an item first. Additionally, a creature can’t attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can’t attune to more than one <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/ring-of-protection\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"ring of protection\">ring of protection</a></span> <span class=\"No-Break\">at a time.</span></p><p>A creature’s attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item <span class=\"No-Break\">is cursed.</span></p><h3>Cursed Items</h3><p>Some magic items bear curses that bedevil their users, sometimes long after a user has stopped using an item. A magic item’s description specifies whether the item is cursed. Most methods of identifying items, including the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"identify\">identify</a></span> spell, fail to reveal such a curse, although lore might hint at it. A curse should be a surprise to the item’s user when the curse’s effects are<span class=\"No-Break\"> revealed.</span></p><p>Attunement to a cursed item can’t be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/remove-curse\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"remove curse\">remove curse</a></span><span class=\"No-Break\"> spell.</span></p><h3>Magic Item Categories</h3><p>Each magic item belongs to a category: armor, potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs, wands, weapons, or wondr<span class=\"No-Break\">ous items.</span></p><h4>Armor</h4><p>Unless an armor’s description says otherwise, armor must be worn for its magic to<span class=\"No-Break\"> function.</span></p><p>Some suits of magic armor specify the type of armor they are, such as chain mail or plate. If a magic armor doesn’t specify its armor type, you may choose the type or determine it<span class=\"No-Break\"> randomly.</span></p><h4>Potions</h4><p>Different kinds of magical liquids are grouped in the category of potions: brews made from enchanted herbs, water from magical fountains or sacred springs, and oils that are applied to a creature or object. Most potions consist of one ounce <span class=\"No-Break\">of liquid.</span></p><p>Potions are consumable magic items. Drinking a potion or administering a potion to another character requires an action. Applying an oil might take longer, as specified in its description. Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it i<span class=\"No-Break\">s used up.</span></p><div>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>VARIANT: MIXING POTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>A character might drink one potion while still under the effects of another, or pour several potions into a single container. The strange ingredients used in creating potions can result in unpredictable interaction<span class=\"No-Break\">s.</span></p>\n<p>When a character mixes two potions together, you can roll on the Potion Miscibility table. If more than two are combined, roll again for each subsequent potion, combining the results. Unless the effects are immediately obvious, reveal them only when they become eviden<span class=\"No-Break\">t.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"PotionMiscibility\" class=\"quick-menu-exclude\">Potion Miscibility</h4>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\"><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"701921258\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[amcg2k5j1vnt0j5d]{Result}</span></div></div></div>\n</div><h4>Rings</h4><p>Magic rings offer an amazing array of powers to those lucky enough to find them. Unless a ring’s description says otherwise, a ring must be worn on a finger, or a similar digit, for the ring’s magic to<span class=\"No-Break\"> function.</span></p><h4>Rods</h4><p>A scepter or just a heavy cylinder, a magic rod is typically made of metal, wood, or bone. It’s about 2 or 3 feet long, 1 inch thick, and 2 to<span class=\"No-Break\"> 5 pounds.</span></p><h4>Scrolls</h4><p>Most scrolls are spells stored in written form, while a few bear unique incantations that produce potent wards. Whatever its contents, a scroll is a roll of paper, sometimes attached to wooden rods, and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal<span class=\"No-Break\">, or wood.</span></p><p>A scroll is a consumable magic item. Whatever the nature of the magic contained in a scroll, unleashing that magic requires&nbsp;the user to read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked, the scroll can’t be used again. Its words fade, or it crumbles <span class=\"No-Break\">into dust.</span></p><p>Unless a scroll's description says otherwise, any creature that can understand a written language can read the script on a scroll and attempt to activate it.</p><div>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>VARIANT: SCROLL MISHAPS</strong></p>\n<p>A creature who tries and fails to cast a spell from a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/spell-scroll\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"spell scroll\">spell scroll</a> </span>must make a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw. If the saving throw fails, roll on the Scroll Mishap tabl<span class=\"No-Break\">e.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"ScrollMishap\" class=\"quick-menu-exclude\">Scroll Mishap</h4>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\"><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-476533084\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[skxVeKV6bY2POZAJ]{Result}</span></div></div></div>\n</div><h4>Staffs</h4><p>A magic staff is about 5 or 6 feet long. Staffs vary widely in appearance: some are of nearly equal diameter throughout and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some are made of wood, and others are composed of polished metal or crystal. Depending on the material, a staff weighs between 2 and<span class=\"No-Break\"> 7 pounds.</span></p><p>Unless a staff’s description says otherwise, a staff can be used as a qua<span class=\"No-Break\">rterstaff.</span></p><h4>Wands</h4><p>A magic wand is about 15 inches long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other<span class=\"No-Break\"> material.</span></p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>VARIANT: WANDS THAT DON'T RECHARGE</strong></p>\n<p>A typical wand has expendable charges. If you’d like wands to be a limited resource, you can make some of them incapable of regaining charges. Consider increasing the base number of charges in such a wand, to a maximum of 25 charges. These charges are never regained once they’re expende<span class=\"No-Break\">d.</span></p>\n</blockquote><h4>Weapons</h4><p>Whether crafted for some fell purpose or forged to serve the highest ideals of chivalry, magic weapons are coveted by many ad<span class=\"No-Break\">venturers.</span></p><p>Some magic weapons specify the type of weapon they are in their descriptions, such as a longsword or longbow. If a magic weapon doesn’t specify its weapon type, you may choose the type or determine it<span class=\"No-Break\"> randomly.</span></p><p>If a magic weapon has the ammunition property, ammunition fired from it is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><h4>Wondrous Items</h4><p>Wondrous items include worn items such as boots, belts, capes, gloves, and various pieces of jewelry and decoration, such as amulets, brooches, and circlets. Bags, carpets, crystal balls, figurines, horns, musical instruments, and other objects also fall into this catch-all<span class=\"No-Break\"> category.</span></p><h3>Wearing and Wielding Items</h3><p>Using a magic item’s properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be hel<span class=\"No-Break\">d in hand.</span></p><p>In most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to t<span class=\"No-Break\">he wearer.</span></p><p>Rare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it doesn’t adjust. For example, armor made by the drow might fit elves only. Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf-sized and dwarf-shaped c<span class=\"No-Break\">haracters.</span></p><p>When a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs has no way to wear ma<span class=\"No-Break\">gic boots.</span></p><h4>Multiple Items of the Same Kind</h4><p>Use common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A character can’t normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, and one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or be able to layer t<span class=\"No-Break\">wo cloaks.</span></p><h4>Paired Items</h4><p>Items that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a <em>boot of striding and springing</em> on one foot and a <em>boot of elvenkind</em> on the other foot gains no benefit from ei<span class=\"No-Break\">ther item.</span></p><h3>Activating an Item</h3><p>Activating some magic items requires a user to do something in particular, such as holding the item and uttering a command word, reading the item if it is a scroll, or drinking it if it is a potion. The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use one or more of the following rules related to their a<span class=\"No-Break\">ctivation.</span></p><p><span class=\"No-Break\">If an item requires an action to activate, that action isn't a function of the Use an&nbsp;Object action, so a feature such as the rogue's Fast Hands can't be used to activate the item.</span></p><h4>Command Word</h4><p>A command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken audibly for the item to operate. A magic item that requires the user to speak a command word can’t be activated in the area of any effect that prevents sound, such as the area created by the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/silence\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"silence\">silence</a></span><span class=\"No-Break\"> spell.</span></p><h4>Consumables</h4><p>Some items are used up when they are activated. A potion or elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic and no longer <span class=\"No-Break\">functions.</span></p><h4>Spells</h4><p>Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item, often by expending charges from it. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell and caster level, doesn’t expend any of the user’s spell slots, and requires no components unless the item’s description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell’s effects with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.</p><p>A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don't have a spellcasting ability - perhaps you're a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature - your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply.</p><h4>Charges</h4><p>Some magic items have charges that you expend to activate its properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"identify\">identify</a></span> spell is cast on the item, or when a creature attunes to the item. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to that item learns how many charges it<span class=\"No-Break\"> regained.</span></p><h3>Magic Item Resilience</h3><p>Most magic items are objects of extraordinary artisanship, assembled from the finest materials with meticulous attention to detail. Thanks to this combination of careful crafting and magical reinforcement, a magic item is at least as durable as a regular item of its kind. Most magic items, other than potions and scrolls, have resistance to all damage. Artifacts are practically indestructible, requiring extreme measures t<span class=\"No-Break\">o destroy.</span></p><h3>Special Features</h3><p>You can add distinctiveness to a magic item by thinking about its backstory, in much the same way you would for a location. Who made the item? Is anything unusual about its construction? Why was it made, and how was it originally used? What minor magical quirks set it apart from other items of its kind? Considering these questions is useful for turning a generic magic item, such as a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/longsword-1\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"longsword, +1\">longsword, +1</a></span> or a suit of <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/chain-mail-1\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"chain mail, +1\">chain mail, +1</a></span>, into a more remarkable <span class=\"No-Break\">discovery.</span></p><p>The tables that follow can help you come up with answers. Roll on as many of these tables as you like. Some of the table entries make more sense for certain items than for others. Some magic items are made only by certain kinds of creatures, for instance; a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/cloak-of-elvenkind\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"cloak of elvenkind\">cloak of elvenkind</a></span> is made by elves, rather than dwarves. If you roll something that doesn’t make sense, roll again, choose a more appropriate entry, or use the rolled detail as inspiration to make up<span class=\"No-Break\"> your own.</span></p><h4>Who Created It or Was Intended to Use It?</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-59849923\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[fjzX12p7TcurnweR]{Creator or Intended User}</span></div></div></div><h4>What Is a Detail from Its History?</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"418667920\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[3Gny4MHYFtU4eCNt]{History}</span></div></div></div><h4>What Minor Property Does It Have?</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-537019560\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[fPp36sAwrKHkl3Bx]{Minor Property}</span></div></div></div><h4>What Quirk Does It Have?</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-2089281372\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[AbQlZYE589t8Dcch]{Quirk}</span></div></div></div><h3>Random Magic Items</h3><p>When you use a Treasure Hoard table to randomly determine the contents of a treasure hoard and your roll indicates the presence of one or more magic items, you can determine the specific magic items by rolling on the appropriate tabl<span class=\"No-Break\">e(s) here.</span></p><h4>Magic Item Table A</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-289821193\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[ANyoXlOCNHtIxhdd]{Magic Item}</span></div></div></div><h4>Magic Item Table B</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-289821162\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[8RdELw2VpA8mQwZL]{Magic Item}</span></div></div></div><h4>Magic Item Table C</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-289821131\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[Estlxi1qagaIm9Af]{Magic Item}</span></div></div></div><h4>Magic Item Table D</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-289821100\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[KCWdkVIQCjhy2eeh]{Magic Item}</span></div></div></div><h4>Magic Item Table E</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-289821069\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[Y6EDVgvnEvi5nyzn]{Magic Item}</span></div></div></div><h4>Magic Item Table F</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-289821038\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[9xU04h0iVkEo0dZq]{Magic Item}</span></div></div></div><h4>Magic Item Table G</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-289821007\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[t0e6Sdbem1wMHKmk]{Magic Item}</span></div></div></div><h4>Magic Item Table H</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-289820976\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[hPq6WZjyB0SBffJ9]{Magic Item}</span></div></div></div><h4>Magic Item Table I</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-289820945\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[EoapoIgrusCKGYht]{Magic Item}</span></div></div></div><h3>Magic Items A–Z</h3><p><a title=\"View Magic Items\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/magic-items-a-z\">View Magic Items</a></p>","img":null,"_id":"8hAOWF8bXl6viniR"}

The decanter weighs<span class=\"No-Break\"> 2 pounds.</span></p>\n<p>You can use an action to remove the stopper and speak one of three command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice) pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the followin<span class=\"No-Break\">g options:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Stream” produces 1 gallon<span class=\"No-Break\"> of water.</span></li>\n<li>“Fountain” produces 5 gallons<span class=\"No-Break\"> of water.</span></li>\n<li>“Geyser” produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus action while holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a>.

A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 <span class=\"No-Break\">− 1 cards.</span></p>\n<p>The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 fe<span class=\"No-Break\">et of you.</span></p>\n<p>An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature (as presented in the <span class=\"italic\">Monster Manual</span>), except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\">Investigation</a>) check. The creature then appears tr<span class=\"No-Break\">anslucent.</span></p>\n<p>The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled.

For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to A<span class=\"No-Break\">C from it.</span></p><h3>Demon Armor</h3><p>Armor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)</p><p>While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal.

The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don’t prevent the creature from passing through an interdimension<span class=\"No-Break\">al portal.</span></p><p>You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) check.

The globe hovers in this way until you or another creature grasps it. If you move more than 60 feet from the hovering globe, it follows you until it is within 60 feet of you. It takes the shortest route to do so. If prevented from moving, the globe sinks gently to the ground and becomes inactive, and its light <span class=\"No-Break\">winks out.</span></p><h3>Dust of Disappearance</h3><p>Wondrous item, uncommon</p><p>Found in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it for one use.

The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect.

You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet’s weight is n<span class=\"No-Break\">egligible.</span></p><p>Someone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pelle<span class=\"No-Break\">t’s magic.</span></p><p>An elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a succe<span class=\"No-Break\">ssful one.</span></p><h3>Dust of Sneezing and Choking</h3><p>Wondrous item, uncommon</p><p>Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand.

There is enough of it fo<span class=\"No-Break\">r one use.</span></p><p>When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a> and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success.

Closing the bottle requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes.

Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses <span class=\"No-Break\">its magic.</span></p><p>You gain the following benefits while w<span class=\"No-Break\">earing it:</span></p><ul>\n<li>You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm’s gems of the specified type as a component: <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/daylight\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"daylight\">daylight</a></span> (opal), <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"fireball\">fireball</a></span> (fire opal), <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/prismatic-spray\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"prismatic spray\">prismatic spray</a></span> (diamond), or <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wall-of-fire\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"wall of fire\">wall of fire</a></span> (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from<span class=\"No-Break\"> the helm.</span></li>\n<li>As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radia<span class=\"No-Break\">nt damage.</span></li>\n<li>As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to fi<span class=\"No-Break\">re damage.</span></li>\n<li>As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow t<span class=\"No-Break\">he weapon.</span></li>\n</ul><p>Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then <span class=\"No-Break\">destroyed.</span></p><h3>Helm of Comprehending Languages</h3><p>Wondrous item, uncommon</p><p>While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/comprehend-languages\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"comprehend languages\">comprehend languages</a></span> spell from i<span class=\"No-Break\">t at will.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/1/186/c7a-04-21.png\"></span></p><h3>Helm of Telepathy</h3><p>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</p><p>While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-thoughts\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"detect thoughts\">detect thoughts</a></span> spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply—using a bonus action to do so—while your focus on it <span class=\"No-Break\">continues.</span></p><p>While focusing on a creature with <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-thoughts\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"detect thoughts\">detect thoughts</a></span>, you can use an action to cast the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/suggestion\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"suggestion\">suggestion</a> </span>spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature.

Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its<span class=\"No-Break\"> contents.</span></p><p>Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magical<span class=\"No-Break\">ly on top.</span></p><p>The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to <span class=\"No-Break\">suffocate.</span></p><p>Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/bag-of-holding\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"bag of holding\">bag of holding</a></span>, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/portable-hole\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"portable hole\">portable hole</a></span>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be<span class=\"No-Break\"> reopened.</span></p><h3>Holy Avenger</h3><p>Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement by a paladin)</p><p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a fiend or an undead with it, that creature takes an extra 2d10 radia<span class=\"No-Break\">nt damage.</span></p><p>While you hold the drawn sword, it creates an aura in a 10-foot radius around you. You and all creatures friendly to you in the aura have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius of the aura increases t<span class=\"No-Break\">o 30 feet.</span></p><h3>Horn of Blasting</h3><p>Wondrous item, rare</p><p>You can use an action to speak the horn’s command word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Deafened\">deafened</a> for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Deafened\">deafened</a>. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d6 thunder damage inste<span class=\"No-Break\">ad of 5d6.</span></p><p>Each use of the horn’s magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys<span class=\"No-Break\"> the horn.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/1/187/c7a-04-22.png\"></span></p><h3>Horn of Valhalla</h3><p>Wondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze), or legendary (iron)</p><p>You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear within 60 feet of you. These spirits use the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/berserker\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"berserker\">berserker</a> statistics from the <span class=\"italic\"><em>Monster Manual</em>.</span> They return to Ysgard after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points.

While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores difficult terrain. In addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a> from a for<span class=\"No-Break\">ced march.</span></p><h3>Horseshoes of Speed</h3><p>Wondrous item, rare</p><p>These iron horseshoes come in a set of four.

You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn’t move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on <span class=\"No-Break\">a success.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/1/188/c7a-04-23.png\"></span></p><h3>Instrument of the Bards</h3><p>Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement by a bard)</p><p>An <span class=\"italic\">instrument of the bards</span> is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college.

A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psych<span class=\"No-Break\">ic damage.</span></p><p>You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells.

If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time.

In addition, whenever you start your turn underwater with 0 hit points, the armor causes you to rise 60 feet toward the surface. The armor is decorated with fish and she<span class=\"No-Break\">ll motifs.</span></p><h3>Medallion of Thoughts</h3><p>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</p><p>The medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-thoughts\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"detect thoughts\">detect thoughts</a></span> spell (save DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d3 expended charges dail<span class=\"No-Break\">y at dawn.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/1/193/c7a-04-28.png\"></span></p><h3>Mirror of Life Trapping</h3><p>Wondrous item, very rare</p><p>When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 h<span class=\"No-Break\">it points.</span></p><p>If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command w<span class=\"No-Break\">ord again.</span></p><p>Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror’s nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw auto<span class=\"No-Break\">matically.</span></p><p>An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells don’t age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell un<span class=\"No-Break\">til freed.</span></p><p>If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied space<span class=\"No-Break\">s near it.</span></p><p>While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature can then communicate<span class=\"No-Break\"> normally.</span></p><p>In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing awa<span class=\"No-Break\">y from it.</span></p><h3>Mithral Armor</h3><p>Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon</p><p>Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth\">Stealth</a>) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armo<span class=\"No-Break\">r doesn’t.</span></p><h3>Necklace of Adaptation</h3><p>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</p><p>While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cloudkill\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"cloudkill\">cloudkill</a></span> and <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/stinking-cloud\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"stinking cloud\">stinking cloud</a></span> effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some<span class=\"No-Break\"> dragons).</span></p><h3>Necklace of Fireballs</h3><p>Wondrous item, rare</p><p>This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"fireball\">fireball</a></span> spell (sa<span class=\"No-Break\">ve DC 15).</span></p><p>You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"fireball\">fireball</a></span> by 1 for each bead beyond <span class=\"No-Break\">the first.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/1/194/c7a-04-29.png\"></span></p><h3>Necklace of Prayer Beads</h3><p>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)</p><p>This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses <span class=\"No-Break\">its magic.</span></p><p>Six types of magic beads exist. The DM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead’s spell is cast, that bead can’t be used again until the <span class=\"No-Break\">next dawn.</span></p><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"treasure-medium-column\" style=\"text-align: center;\">d20</th>\n<th class=\"treasure-medium-column\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Bead of …</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Spell</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">1–6</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Blessing</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/bless\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"Bless\">Bless</a></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">7–12</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Curing</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"Cure wounds\">Cure wounds</a></span> (2nd level) or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lesser-restoration\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"lesser restoration\">lesser restoration</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">13–16</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Favor</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/greater-restoration\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"Greater restoration\">Greater restoration</a></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">17–18</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Smiting</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/branding-smite\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"Branding smite\">Branding smite</a></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">19</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Summons</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/planar-ally\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"Planar ally\">Planar ally</a></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">20</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wind walking</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wind-walk\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"Wind walk\">Wind walk</a></span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h3>Nine Lives Stealer</h3><p>Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)</p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this mag<span class=\"No-Break\">ic weapon.</span></p><p>The sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this<span class=\"No-Break\"> property.</span></p><h3>Nolzur’s Marvelous Pigments</h3><p>Wondrous item, very rare</p><p>Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on <span class=\"No-Break\">its image.</span></p><p>Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features—such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons—that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 sq<span class=\"No-Break\">uare feet.</span></p><p>When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects y<span class=\"No-Break\">ou create.</span></p><p>Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless<span class=\"No-Break\"> material.</span></p><p>If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to<span class=\"No-Break\"> anything.</span></p><h3>Oathbow</h3><p>Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)</p><p>When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, “Swift defeat to my enemies.” When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a command phrase, say, “Swift death to you who have wronged me.” The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the <span class=\"No-Break\">next dawn.</span></p><p>When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 pierci<span class=\"No-Break\">ng damage.</span></p><p>While your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with all othe<span class=\"No-Break\">r weapons.</span></p><h3>Oil of Etherealness</h3><p>Potion, rare</p><p>Beads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its container and quickly evaporate. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/etherealness\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"etherealness\">etherealness</a></span> spell f<span class=\"No-Break\">or 1 hour.</span></p><h3>Oil of Sharpness</h3><p>Potion, very rare</p><p>This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultrathin silver shards. The oil can coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the coated item is magical and has a +3 bonus to attack and dam<span class=\"No-Break\">age rolls.</span></p><h3>Oil of Slipperiness</h3><p>Potion, uncommon</p><p>This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/freedom-of-movement\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"freedom of movement\">freedom of movement</a></span> spell fo<span class=\"No-Break\">r 8 hours.</span></p><p>Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/grease\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"grease\">grease</a></span> spell in that area fo<span class=\"No-Break\">r 8 hours.</span></p><h3>Pearl of Power</h3><p>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)</p><p>While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you have used the pearl, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p><h3>Periapt of Health</h3><p>Wondrous item, uncommon</p><p>You are immune to contracting any disease while you wear this pendant. If you are already infected with a disease, the effects of the disease are suppressed you while you wear th<span class=\"No-Break\">e pendant.</span></p><h3>Periapt of Proof against Poison</h3><p>Wondrous item, rare</p><p>This delicate silver chain has a brilliant-cut black gem pendant. While you wear it, poisons have no effect on you. You are immune to the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Poisoned\">poisoned</a> condition and have immunity to pois<span class=\"No-Break\">on damage.</span></p><h3>Periapt of Wound Closure</h3><p>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</p><p>While you wear this pendant, you stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of your turn. In addition, whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, double the number of hit points it<span class=\"No-Break\"> restores.</span></p><h3>Philter of Love</h3><p>Potion, uncommon</p><p>The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you become <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a> by that creature for 1 hour. If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a>. This potion’s rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped lik<span class=\"No-Break\">e a heart.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/1/195/c7a-04-30.png\"></span></p><h3>Pipes of Haunting</h3><p>Wondrous item, uncommon</p><p>You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren’t hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges dail<span class=\"No-Break\">y at dawn.</span></p><h3>Pipes of the Sewers</h3><p>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</p><p>You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or <span class=\"No-Break\">harm them.</span></p><p>The pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/swarm-of-rats\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"swarm of rats\">swarm of rats</a> (see the <span class=\"italic\">Monster Manual</span> for statistics) with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the DM). If there aren’t enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren’t under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges dail<span class=\"No-Break\">y at dawn.</span></p><p>Whenever a swarm of rats that isn’t under another creature’s control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm’s Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes’ music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can’t hear the pipes’ music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next<span class=\"No-Break\"> 24 hours.</span></p><h3>Plate Armor of Etherealness</h3><p>Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)</p><p>While you’re wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an action to gain the effect of the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/etherealness\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"etherealness\">etherealness</a></span> spell, which last for 10 minutes or until you remove the armor or use an action to speak the command word again. This property of the armor can’t be used again until the <span class=\"No-Break\">next dawn.</span>&nbsp;</p><h3>Portable Hole</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/1/215/c7b-fullpage.jpg\"></p><p>Wondrous item, rare</p><p>This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in<span class=\"No-Break\"> diameter.</span></p><p>You can use an action to unfold a <span class=\"italic\">portable hole</span> and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the <span class=\"italic\">portable hole</span> creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can’t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open <span class=\"italic\">portable hole</span> can exit the hole by climbing <span class=\"No-Break\">out of it.</span></p><p>You can use an action to close a <span class=\"italic\">portable hole</span> by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what’s in it, the hole weighs next t<span class=\"No-Break\">o nothing.</span></p><p>If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the <span class=\"italic\">portable hole</span> or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed <span class=\"italic\">portable hole</span> can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to <span class=\"No-Break\">suffocate.</span></p><p>Placing a <span class=\"italic\">portable hole</span> inside an extradimensional space created by a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/bag-of-holding\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"bag of holding\">bag of holding</a></span>, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/hewards-handy-haversack\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"Heward’s handy haversack\">Heward’s handy haversack</a></span>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be<span class=\"No-Break\"> reopened.</span></p><h3>Potion of Animal Friendship</h3><p>Potion, uncommon</p><p>When you drink this potion, you can cast the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/animal-friendship\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"animal friendship\">animal friendship</a></span> spell (save DC 13) for 1 hour at will.

An eyeball bobs in this yellowish liquid but vanishes when the potion <span class=\"No-Break\">is opened.</span></p><h3>Potion of Climbing</h3><p>Potion, common</p><p>When you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) checks you make to climb. The potion is separated into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix t<span class=\"No-Break\">he colors.</span></p><h3>Potion of Diminution</h3><p>Potion, rare</p><p>When you drink this potion, you gain the “reduce” effect of the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/enlarge-reduce\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"enlarge/reduce\">enlarge/reduce</a></span> spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt thi<span class=\"No-Break\">s process.</span></p><h3>Potion of Fire Breath</h3><p>Potion, uncommon</p><p>After drinking this potion, you can use a bonus action to exhale fire at a target within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The effect ends after you exhale the fire three times or when 1 hour h<span class=\"No-Break\">as passed.</span></p><p>This potion’s orange liquid flickers, and smoke fills the top of the container and wafts out whenever it <span class=\"No-Break\">is opened.</span></p><h3>Potion of Flying</h3><p>Potion, very rare</p><p>When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. If you’re in the air when the potion wears off, you fall unless you have some other means of staying aloft. This potion’s clear liquid floats at the top of its container and has cloudy white impurities drift<span class=\"No-Break\">ing in it.</span></p><h3>Potion of Gaseous Form</h3><p>Potion, rare</p><p>When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gaseous-form\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"gaseous form\">gaseous form</a></span> spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action.

The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-fo<span class=\"No-Break\">ot radius.</span></p><p>As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within a 15-foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a succe<span class=\"No-Break\">ssful one.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/1/200/c7a-04-35.png\"></span></p><h3>Ring of Spell Storing</h3><p>Ring, rare (requires attunement)</p><p>This ring stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d6 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen <span class=\"No-Break\">by the DM.</span></p><p>Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can’t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much spac<span class=\"No-Break\">e it uses.</span></p><p>While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing<span class=\"No-Break\"> up space.</span></p><h3>Ring of Spell Turning</h3><p>Ring, legendary (requires attunement)</p><p>While wearing this ring, you have advantage on saving throws against any spell that targets only you (not in an area of effect). In addition, if you roll a 20 for the save and the spell is 7th level or lower, the spell has no effect on you and instead targets the caster, using the slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of t<span class=\"No-Break\">he caster.</span></p><h3>Ring of Swimming</h3><p>Ring, uncommon</p><p>You have a swimming speed of 40 feet while wearing <span class=\"No-Break\">this ring.</span></p><h3>Ring of Telekinesis</h3><p>Ring, very rare (requires attunement)</p><p>While wearing this ring, you can cast the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/telekinesis\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"telekinesis\">telekinesis</a></span> spell at will, but you can target only objects that aren’t being worn o<span class=\"No-Break\">r carried.</span></p><h3>Ring of the Ram</h3><p>Ring, rare (requires attunement)</p><p>This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to expend 1 to 3 of its charges to attack one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The ring produces a spectral ram’s head and makes its attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes 2d10 force damage and is pushed 5 feet away<span class=\"No-Break\"> from you.</span></p><p>Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring’s charges as an action to try to break an object you can see within 60 feet of you that isn’t being worn or carried. The ring makes a Strength check with a +5 bonus for each charge <span class=\"No-Break\">you spend.</span></p><h3>Ring of Three Wishes</h3><p>Ring, legendary</p><p>While wearing this ring, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 3 charges to cast the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wish\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"wish\">wish</a></span> spell from it.

When you do so, you can see into and through solid matter for 1 minute. This vision has a radius of 30 feet. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don’t prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin shee<span class=\"No-Break\">t of lead.</span></p><p>Whenever you use the ring again before taking a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of e<span class=\"No-Break\">xhaustion.</span></p><h3>Robe of Eyes</h3><p>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</p><p>This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns.

Although you can close or avert your own eyes, you are never considered to be doing so while wearing <span class=\"No-Break\">this robe.</span></p><p>A<span class=\"italic\"> <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/light\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"light\">light</a></span> spell cast on the robe or a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/daylight\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"daylight\">daylight</a></span> spell cast within 5 feet of the robe causes you to be <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded\">blinded</a> for 1 minute.

While you wear it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until the end of your next turn. During this time, the robe sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Creatures that can see you have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. In addition, any creature in the bright light that can see you when the robe’s power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Stunned\">stunned</a> until the ef<span class=\"No-Break\">fect ends.</span></p><h3>Robe of Stars</h3><p>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</p><p>This black or dark blue robe is embroidered with small white or silver stars. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws while yo<span class=\"No-Break\">u wear it.</span></p><p>Six stars, located on the robe’s upper front portion, are particularly large. While wearing this robe, you can use an action to pull off one of the stars and use it to cast <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"magic missile\">magic missile</a></span> as a 5th-level spell. Daily at dusk, 1d6 removed stars reappear on<span class=\"No-Break\"> the robe.</span></p><p>While you wear the robe, you can use an action to enter the Astral Plane along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there until you use an action to return to the plane you were on. You reappear in the last space you occupied, or if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccup<span class=\"No-Break\">ied space.</span></p><h3>Robe of the Archmagi</h3><p>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)</p><p>This elegant garment is made from exquisite cloth of white, gray, or black and adorned with silvery runes. The robe’s color corresponds to the alignment for which the item was created. A white robe was made for good, gray for neutral, and black for evil. You can’t attune to a <span class=\"italic\">robe of the archmagi</span> that doesn’t correspond to your <span class=\"No-Break\">alignment.</span></p><p>You gain these benefits while wearing<span class=\"No-Break\"> the robe:</span></p><ul>\n<li>If you aren’t wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 15 + your Dexterity<span class=\"No-Break\"> modifier.</span></li>\n<li>You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magica<span class=\"No-Break\">l effects.</span></li>\n<li>Your spell save DC and spell attack bonus each incr<span class=\"No-Break\">ease by 2.</span></li>\n</ul><div>&nbsp;</div><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/1/201/c7a-04-36.png\"></p><h3>Robe of Useful Items</h3><p>Wondrous item, uncommon</p><p>This robe has cloth patches of various shapes and colors covering it. While wearing the robe, you can use an action to detach one of the patches, causing it to become the object or creature it represents. Once the last patch is removed, the robe becomes an ordinar<span class=\"No-Break\">y garment.</span></p><p>The robe has two of each of the followin<span class=\"No-Break\">g patches:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Dagger</li>\n<li>Bullseye lantern (fille<span class=\"No-Break\">d and lit)</span></li>\n<li>St<span class=\"No-Break\">eel mirror</span></li>\n<li>10<span class=\"No-Break\">-foot pole</span></li>\n<li>Hempen rope (50 fee<span class=\"No-Break\">t, coiled)</span></li>\n<li>Sack</li>\n</ul><p>In addition, the robe has 4d4 other patches.

The absorbed spell’s effect is canceled, and the spell’s energy—not the spell itself—is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can’t store, the rod has no effect on t<span class=\"No-Break\">hat spell.</span></p><p>When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently h<span class=\"No-Break\">as stored.</span></p><p>If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level s<span class=\"No-Break\">pell slot.</span></p><p>A newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes n<span class=\"No-Break\">onmagical.</span></p><h3>Rod of Alertness</h3><p>Rod, very rare (requires attunement)</p><p>This rod has a flanged head and the following p<span class=\"No-Break\">roperties.</span></p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Alertness.</span> While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) checks and on rolls for i<span class=\"No-Break\">nitiative.</span></p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Spells. </span>While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-evil-and-good\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"detect evil and good\">detect evil and good</a></span>, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"detect magic\">detect magic</a></span>, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-poison-and-disease\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"detect poison and disease\">detect poison and disease</a></span>, or <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/see-invisibility\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"see invisibility\">see invisibility</a>.</span></p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Protective Aura.</span> As an action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod’s head sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible\">invisible</a> hostile creature that is also in the bri<span class=\"No-Break\">ght light.</span></p><p>The rod’s head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground. This property can’t be used again until the <span class=\"No-Break\">next dawn.</span></p><h3>Rod of Lordly Might</h3><p>Rod, legendary (requires attunement)</p><p>This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detai<span class=\"No-Break\">led below.</span></p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Six Buttons.</span> You can press one of the rod’s six buttons as a bonus action. A button’s effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its no<span class=\"No-Break\">rmal form.</span></p><p>If you press <span class=\"bold\">button 1</span>, the rod becomes a <em><span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/flame-tongue\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"flame tongue\">flame tongue</a></span></em>, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod’s fla<span class=\"No-Break\">nged head (you choose the type of sword).</span></p><p>If you press <span class=\"bold\">button 2</span>, the rod’s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls mad<span class=\"No-Break\">e with it.</span></p><p>If you press <span class=\"bold\">button 3</span>, the rod’s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls mad<span class=\"No-Break\">e with it.</span></p><p>If you press <span class=\"bold\">button 4</span>, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its no<span class=\"No-Break\">rmal form.</span></p><p>If you press <span class=\"bold\">button 5</span>, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other<span class=\"No-Break\"> barriers.</span></p><p>If you press <span class=\"bold\">button 6</span>, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height<span class=\"No-Break\"> above it.</span></p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Drain Life.</span> When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can’t be used again until the <span class=\"No-Break\">next dawn.</span></p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Paralyze</span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">.</span> When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Paralyzed\">paralyzed</a> for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can’t be used again until the <span class=\"No-Break\">next dawn.</span></p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Terrify.</span> While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> of you for 1 minute. A <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The bonus is determined by the rod<span class=\"No-Break\">’s rarity.</span></p><p>In addition, you can regain one warlock spell slot as an action while holding the rod. You can’t use this property again until you finish a <span class=\"No-Break\">long rest.</span></p><h3>Rod of Resurrection</h3><p>Rod, legendary (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)</p><p>The rod has 5 charges. While you hold it, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/heal\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"heal\">heal</a></span> (expends 1 charge) or <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/resurrection\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"resurrection\">resurrection</a></span> (expends 5<span class=\"No-Break\"> charges).</span></p><p>The rod regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If the rod is reduced to 0 charges, roll a d20. On a 1, the rod disappears in a burst of<span class=\"No-Break\"> radiance.</span></p><h3>Rod of Rulership</h3><p>Rod, rare (requires attunement)</p><p>You can use an action to present the rod and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a> by you for 8 hours. While <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a> in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a> in this way. The rod can’t be used again until the <span class=\"No-Break\">next dawn.</span></p><h3>Rod of Security</h3><p>Rod, very rare</p><p>While holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a paradise that exists in an extraplanar space. You choose the form that the paradise takes. It could be a tranquil garden, lovely glade, cheery tavern, immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside the extrapla<span class=\"No-Break\">nar space.</span></p><p>For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don’t age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (ro<span class=\"No-Break\">und down).</span></p><p>When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that location. The rod can’t be used again until ten days ha<span class=\"No-Break\">ve passed.</span></p><h3>Rope of Climbing</h3><p>Wondrous item, uncommon</p><p>This 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and can hold up to 3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak the command word, the rope animates. As a bonus action, you can command the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for<span class=\"No-Break\"> carrying.</span></p><p>If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to<span class=\"No-Break\"> climb it.</span></p><p>The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is <span class=\"No-Break\">destroyed.</span></p><h3>Rope of Entanglement</h3><p>Wondrous item, rare</p><p>This rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained\">restrained</a>.</p><p>You can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained\">restrained</a> by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target’s choice).

In addition, you can use your reaction when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do, the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell’s level. However, if doing so brings the staff’s total number of charges above 50, the staff explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (s<span class=\"No-Break\">ee below).</span></p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Spells.</span> While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/conjure-elemental\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"conjure elemental\">conjure elemental</a></span> (7 charges), <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dispel magic\">dispel magic</a></span> (3 charges), <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"fireball\">fireball</a></span> (7th-level version, 7 charges), <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/flaming-sphere\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"flaming sphere\">flaming sphere</a></span> (2 charges), <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/ice-storm\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"ice storm\">ice storm</a></span> (4 charges), <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/invisibility\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"invisibility\">invisibility</a> </span>(2 charges), <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/knock\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"knock\">knock</a></span> (2 charges), <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lightning-bolt\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"lightning bolt\">lightning bolt</a></span> (7th-level version, 7 charges), <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/passwall\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"passwall\">passwall</a></span> (5 charges), <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"plane shift\">plane shift</a></span> (7 charges), <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/telekinesis\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"telekinesis\">telekinesis</a></span> (5 charges), <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wall-of-fire\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"wall of fire\">wall of fire</a></span> (4 charges), or <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/web\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"web\">web</a></span> (2<span class=\"No-Break\"> charges).</span></p><p>You can also use an action to cast one of the following spells from the staff without using any charges: <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/arcane-lock\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"arcane lock\">arcane lock</a></span>, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"detect magic\">detect magic</a></span>, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/enlarge-reduce\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"enlarge/reduce\">enlarge/reduce</a></span>, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/light\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"light\">light</a></span>, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mage-hand\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"mage hand\">mage hand</a></span>, or <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"protection from evil and good\">protection from evil and good</a>.</span></p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Retributive Strike.</span> You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike.

If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw.

A creature that is neither good nor evil in alignment takes 6d6 necrotic damage upon touching the talisman. A good creature takes 8d6 necrotic damage upon touching the talisman. Either sort of creature takes the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the<span class=\"No-Break\"> talisman.</span></p><p>If you are an evil cleric or paladin, you can use the talisman as a holy symbol, and you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear o<span class=\"No-Break\">r hold it.</span></p><p>The talisman has 6 charges. If you are wearing or holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the talisman and choose one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If the target is of good alignment, a flaming fissure opens under it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the fissure and be destroyed, leaving no remains. The fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence.

While holding the rod, you can use an action to direct each tentacle to attack a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Each tentacle makes a melee attack roll with a +9 bonus. On a hit, the tentacle deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If you hit a target with all three tentacles, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature’s speed is halved, it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it can’t use reactions for 1 minute. Moreover, on each of its turns, it can take either an action or a bonus action, but not both. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on <span class=\"No-Break\">a success.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/1/209/c7a-04-44.png\"></span></p><h3>Tome of Clear Thought</h3><p>Wondrous item, very rare</p><p>This book contains memory and logic exercises, and its words are charged with magic.

Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in<span class=\"No-Break\"> the side.</span></p><p>Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never<span class=\"No-Break\"> sentient.</span></p><p>Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the DM’s control. Any activated property of the item is under the item’s control, not its wielder’s. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against th<span class=\"No-Break\">e wielder.</span></p><h2>Creating Sentient Magic Items</h2><p>When you decide to make a magic item sentient, you create the item’s persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions descr<span class=\"No-Break\">ibed here.</span></p><h3>Abilities</h3><p>A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can choose the item’s abilities or determine them randomly. To determine them randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling<span class=\"No-Break\"> the rest.</span></p><h3>Communication</h3><p>A sentient item has some ability to communicate, either by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the follow<span class=\"No-Break\">ing table.</span></p><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1454667877\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[bRwusRlGamn07gpi]{Communication}</span></div></div></div><h3>Senses</h3><p>With sentience comes awareness. A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on the follow<span class=\"No-Break\">ing table.</span></p><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1921822786\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[iCcVpEwtzMTXTSF6]{Senses}</span></div></div></div><h3>Alignment</h3><p>A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. If not, you can pick an alignment or roll on the follow<span class=\"No-Break\">ing table.</span></p><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\">d100</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Alignment</th>\n<th>d100</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Alignment</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>01–15</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Lawful good</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">74–85</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Chaotic neutral</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16–35</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Neutral good</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">86–89</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Lawful evil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>36–50</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Chaotic good</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">90–96</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Neutral evil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>51–63</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Lawful neutral</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">97–00</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Chaotic evil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>64–73</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Neutral</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h3>Characteristics</h3><p>Use the information on creating NPCs in <a title=\"Creating Nonplayer Characters\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters\">chapter 4</a>&nbsp;to develop a sentient item’s mannerisms, personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. You can also draw on the “Special Features” section earlier in thi<span class=\"No-Break\">s chapter.</span></p><p>If you determine these characteristics randomly, ignore or adapt any result that doesn’t make sense for an inanimate object. You can reroll until you get a result<span class=\"No-Break\"> you like.</span></p><h3>Special Purpose</h3><p>You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated properties. You can pick a special purpose or roll on the follow<span class=\"No-Break\">ing table.</span></p><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-31098238\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[6wok4wCDcb4TjbxM]{Purpose}</span></div></div></div><h2>Conflict</h2><p>A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder’s Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the followin<span class=\"No-Break\">g demands:</span></p><ul>\n<li>The item insists on being carried or worn at <span class=\"No-Break\">all times.</span></li>\n<li>The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything the item finds <span class=\"No-Break\">repugnant.</span></li>\n<li>The item demands that its wielder pursue the item’s goals to the exclusion of all ot<span class=\"No-Break\">her goals.</span></li>\n<li>The item demands to be given to som<span class=\"No-Break\">eone else.</span></li>\n</ul><p>If its wielder refuses to comply with the item’s wishes, the item can do any or all of the <span class=\"No-Break\">following:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Make it impossible for its wielder to att<span class=\"No-Break\">une to it.</span></li>\n<li>Suppress one or more of its activated p<span class=\"No-Break\">roperties.</span></li>\n<li>Attempt to take control of it<span class=\"No-Break\">s wielder.</span></li>\n</ul><p>If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item’s Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a> by the item for 1d12 hours. While <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a>, the wielder must try to follow the item’s commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can’t use this power again until the <span class=\"No-Break\">next dawn.</span></p><h2>Sample Sentient Items</h2><p>The sentient weapons described here have storied <span class=\"No-Break\">histories.</span></p><h3>Blackrazor</h3><p>Weapon (greatsword), legendary (requires attunement by a creature of non-lawful alignment)</p><p>Hidden in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, <span class=\"italic\">Blackrazor</span> shines like a piece of night sky filled with stars.

It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of<span class=\"No-Break\"> 120 feet.</span></p><p>The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically.

If the sword goes three days or more without consuming a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the ne<span class=\"No-Break\">xt sunset.</span></p><h3>Moonblade</h3><p>Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement by an elf or half-elf of neutral good alignment)</p><p>Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a <span class=\"italic\">moonblade.</span> In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapo<span class=\"No-Break\">ns remain.</span></p><p>A <span class=\"italic\">moonblade</span> passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to <span class=\"No-Break\">its power.</span></p><p>A <span class=\"italic\">moonblade</span> serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the e<span class=\"No-Break\">lven gods.</span></p><p>A <span class=\"italic\">moonblade</span> won’t serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is <span class=\"No-Break\">destroyed.</span></p><p>A <span class=\"italic\">moonblade</span> has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the <span class=\"italic\">moonblade</span> an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Propert<span class=\"No-Break\">ies table.</span></p><p><strong>Moonblade Properties</strong></p><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1392563292\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[T8Xe2qOZF7MS4P4S]{Property}</span></div></div></div><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Sentience.</span> A <span class=\"italic\">moonblade</span> is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12.

Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of thi<span class=\"No-Break\">s purpose.</span></p><p>The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is<span class=\"No-Break\"> absolute.</span></p><p>If a <span class=\"italic\">moonblade</span> has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elv<span class=\"No-Break\">en ideals.</span></p><h3>Wave</h3><p>Weapon (trident), legendary (requires attunement by a creature that worships a god of the sea)</p><p>Held in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, this trident is an exquisite weapon engraved with images of waves, shells, and sea creatures. Although you must worship a god of the sea to attune to this weapon, <span class=\"italic\">Wave</span> happily accepts new<span class=\"No-Break\"> converts.</span></p><p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of<span class=\"No-Break\"> 120 feet.</span></p><p>The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Aquan.

Conflict arises if the wielder fails to further the weapon’s objectives in <span class=\"No-Break\">the world.</span></p><p>The trident has a nostalgic attachment to the place where it was forged, a desolate island called Thunderforge. A sea god imprisoned a family of storm giants there, and the giants forged <span class=\"italic\">Wave</span> in an act of devotion to — or rebellion against<span class=\"No-Break\"> — that god.</span></p><p><span class=\"italic\">Wave</span> harbors a secret doubt about its own nature and purpose. For all its devotion to the sea gods, <span class=\"italic\">Wave</span> fears that it was intended to bring about a particular sea god’s demise. This destiny is something <span class=\"italic\">Wave</span> might not be able<span class=\"No-Break\"> to avert.</span></p><h3>Whelm</h3><p>Weapon (warhammer), legendary (requires attunement by a dwarf)</p><p><span class=\"italic\">Whelm</span> is a powerful warhammer forged by dwarves and lost in the dungeon of White Plume<span class=\"No-Break\"> Mountain.</span></p><p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. At dawn the day after you first make an attack roll with <span class=\"italic\">Whelm</span>, you develop a fear of being outdoors that persists as long as you remain attuned to the weapon. This causes you to have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks while you can see the da<span class=\"No-Break\">ytime sky.</span></p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Thrown Weapon.</span> <span class=\"italic\">Whelm</span> has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using it, the target takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage, or an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the target is a giant. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your hand after the attack. If you don’t have a hand free, the weapon lands at <span class=\"No-Break\">your feet.</span></p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Shock Wave.</span> You can use an action to strike the ground with <span class=\"italic\">Whelm</span> and send a shock wave out from the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the <span class=\"No-Break\">next dawn.</span></p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Supernatural Awareness.</span> While you are holding the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or concealed doors within 30 feet of you.

It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of<span class=\"No-Break\"> 120 feet.</span></p><p>The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Dwarvish, Giant, and Goblin. It shouts battle cries in Dwarvish when used <span class=\"No-Break\">in combat.</span></p><p><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Personality.</span> <span class=\"italic\">Whelm</span>’s purpose is to slaughter giants and goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves against all enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy goblins and giants or to protec<span class=\"No-Break\">t dwarves.</span></p><p><span class=\"italic\">Whelm</span> has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything to protect those dwarves <span class=\"No-Break\">from harm.</span></p><p>The hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a vampire. His will was strong enough that he bent <span class=\"italic\">Whelm</span> to his evil purposes, even killing members of his<span class=\"No-Break\"> own clan.</span></p><div>\n<h2 id=\"Artifacts\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Artifacts</h2>\n<p>An artifact is a unique magic item of tremendous power, with its own origin and history. An artifact might have been created by gods or mortals of awesome power. It could have been created in the midst of a crisis that threatened a kingdom, a world, or the entire multiverse, and carry the weight of that pivotal moment i<span class=\"No-Break\">n history.</span></p>\n<p>Some artifacts appear when they are needed most. For others, the reverse is true; when discovered, the world trembles at the ramifications of the find. In either case, introducing an artifact into a campaign requires forethought. The artifact could be an item that opposing sides are hoping to claim, or it might be something the adventurers need to overcome their greatest <span class=\"No-Break\">challenge.</span></p>\n<p>Characters don’t typically find artifacts in the normal course of adventuring. In fact, artifacts only appear when you want them to, for they are as much plot devices as magic items. Tracking down and recovering an artifact is often the main goal of an adventure. Characters must chase down rumors, undergo significant trials, and venture into dangerous, half-forgotten places to find the artifact they seek. Alternatively, a major villain might already have the artifact. Obtaining and destroying the artifact could be the only way to ensure that its power can’t be used<span class=\"No-Break\"> for evil.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/870/c7c-01.png\"></span></p>\n<h2 id=\"ArtifactProperties\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Artifact Properties</h2>\n<p>Each artifact has its own magical properties, as other magic items do, and the properties are often exceptionally powerful.

You can also invent new beneficial and detrimental properties. These properties typically change each time an artifact appears in <span class=\"No-Break\">the world.</span></p>\n<p>An artifact can have as many as four minor beneficial properties and two major beneficial properties.

He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever com<span class=\"No-Break\">ing about.</span></p>\n<p>Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rot<span class=\"No-Break\">ted Tower.</span></p>\n<p>Some say that Vecna’s lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King’s rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna’s tower a heap of ash.

{"name":" 12 Chapter 7: Other Rewards","permission":{"default":0,"DJNYgTCLxATVgLjS":3},"flags":{"vtta":{"name":"12 Chapter 7: Other Rewards","sceneId":null}},"content":"<h1>Chapter 7: Other Rewards</h1><p>As much as adventurers desire treasure, they often appreciate other forms of reward. This section presents a variety of ways that gods, monarchs, and other beings of power might recognize the characters’ accomplishments, including supernatural gifts that give characters new capabilities; titles, lands, and other marks of prestige; and boons that are available only to adventurers who have reached 2<span class=\"No-Break\">0th level.</span></p><h2>Supernatural Gifts</h2><p>A supernatural gift is a special reward granted by a being or force of great magical power. Such supernatural gifts come in two forms: blessings and charms. A blessing is usually bestowed by a god or a godlike being. A charm is typically the work of a powerful spirit, a location of ancient magic, or a creature that has legendary actions. Unlike a magic item, a supernatural gift isn’t an object and doesn’t require attunement. It gives a character an extraordinary ability, which can be used one or m<span class=\"No-Break\">ore times.</span></p><h3>Blessings</h3><p>A character might receive a blessing from a deity for doing something truly momentous — an accomplishment that catches the attention of both gods and mortals. Killing rampaging gnolls rarely warrants such a blessing, but slaying the high priest of Tiamat as he attempts to summon the Dragon Qu<span class=\"No-Break\">een might.</span></p><p>A blessing is an appropriate reward for one of the following accomp<span class=\"No-Break\">lishments:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Restoring the most sacred shrin<span class=\"No-Break\">e of a god</span></li>\n<li>Foiling an earthshaking plot by the enemie<span class=\"No-Break\">s of a god</span></li>\n<li>Helping a god’s favored servant complete a <span class=\"No-Break\">holy quest</span></li>\n</ul><p>An adventurer might also receive a blessing in advance of a perilous quest. For example, a paladin could receive one before setting out on a quest to slay a terrifying lich that is responsible for a magical plague sweeping<span class=\"No-Break\"> the land.</span></p><p>A character should receive only a blessing that is useful to him or her, and some blessings come with expectations on the part of the benefactor. A god typically gives a blessing for a particular purpose, such as recovering a holy person’s remains or toppling a tyrannical empire. The god might revoke a blessing if a character fails to pursue that purpose or acts coun<span class=\"No-Break\">ter to it.</span></p><p>A character retains the benefits of a blessing forever or until it is taken away by the god who granted it. Unlike a magic item, such a blessing can’t be suppressed by an <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antimagic-field\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"antimagic field\">antimagic field</a></span> or simil<span class=\"No-Break\">ar effect.</span></p><p>Most adventurers go their entire lives without receiving even one of these blessings. There is no limit on the number of blessings a character can receive, but it should be rare for a character to have more than one at a time. Moreover, a character can’t benefit from multiple instances of a blessing at the same time. For example, a character can’t benefit from two instances of the Blessing of Healt<span class=\"No-Break\">h at once.</span></p><p>Example blessings are provided below. The text of a blessing addresses its user. If you decide to create more blessings, consider this: a typical blessing mimics the properties of a wond<span class=\"No-Break\">rous item.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Blessing of Health. </span></strong>Your Constitution score increases by 2, up to a maxi<span class=\"No-Break\">mum of 22.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Blessing of Protection. </span></strong>You gain a +1 bonus to AC and savi<span class=\"No-Break\">ng throws.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Blessing of Magic Resistance. </span></strong>You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magica<span class=\"No-Break\">l effects.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Blessing of Understanding. </span></strong>Your Wisdom score increases by 2, up to a maxi<span class=\"No-Break\">mum of 22.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Blessing of Valhalla. </span></strong>This blessing grants you the power to summon spirit warriors, as if you had blown a silver <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/horn-of-valhalla\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"horn of Valhalla\">horn of Valhalla</a></span>. Once you use this blessing, you can’t use it again until 7 days ha<span class=\"No-Break\">ve passed.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Blessing of Weapon Enhancement. </span></strong>One nonmagical weapon in your possession becomes a <span class=\"italic\">+1 weapon</span> whenever you<span class=\"No-Break\"> wield it.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Blessing of Wound Closure. </span></strong>This blessing grants you the benefits of a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/periapt-of-wound-closure\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"periapt of wound closure\">periapt of wound closure</a></span><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><h3>Charms</h3><p>A charm is a minor supernatural gift, which can be received in a large variety of ways. For example, a wizard who finds an eldritch secret in a dead archmage’s spellbook might be infused with the magic of a charm, as might a character who solves a sphinx’s riddle or drinks from a magic fountain. Legendary creatures, such as ancient gold dragons and unicorns, sometimes grace their allies with charms, and some explorers find themselves bearing the magic of a charm after discovering a long-lost location that is drenched in prime<span class=\"No-Break\">val magic.</span></p><p>Some charms can be used only once, and others can be used a specific number of times before vanishing. If a charm lets you cast a spell, you are able to do so without spending a spell slot or providing any components (verbal, somatic, or material). In any case, a charm can’t be used in the area created by an <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antimagic-field\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"antimagic field\">antimagic field</a></span> or a similar effect, and a charm’s effects are susceptible to <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dispel magic\">dispel magic</a></span> and the like. But the charm itself can’t be removed from a creature by anything short of divine intervention or the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wish\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"wish\">wish</a></span><span class=\"No-Break\"> spell.</span></p><p>Example charms are provided below. The text of a charm addresses its user. A typical charm mimics the effects of a potion or a spell, so it is easy to create more charms of your own, if<span class=\"No-Break\"> you like.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Charm of Animal Conjuring. </span></strong>This charm allows you to cast the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/conjure-animals\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"conjure animals\">conjure animals</a></span> spell (3rd-level version) as an action. Once used three times, the charm vanishes<span class=\"No-Break\"> from you.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Charm of Darkvision. </span></strong>This charm allows you to cast the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/darkvision\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"darkvision\">darkvision</a> spell as an action, no components required. Once used three times, the charm <span class=\"No-Break\">goes away.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Charm of Feather Falling. </span></strong>This charm grants you the benefits of a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/ring-of-feather-falling\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"ring of feather falling\">ring of feather falling</a></span>. These benefits last for 10 days, after which the charm vanishes<span class=\"No-Break\"> from you.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Charm of Heroism. </span></strong>This charm allows you to give yourself the benefit of a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-heroism\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"potion of heroism\">potion of heroism</a></span> as an action. Once you do so, the charm vanishes<span class=\"No-Break\"> from you.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Charm of Restoration. </span></strong>This charm has 6 charges. You can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells: <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/greater-restoration\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"greater restoration\">greater restoration</a></span> (4 charges) or <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lesser-restoration\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"lesser restoration\">lesser restoration</a></span> (2 charges). Once all its charges have been expended, the charm vanishes<span class=\"No-Break\"> from you.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Charm of the Slayer. </span></strong>One sword in your possession becomes a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/dragon-slayer\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"dragon slayer\">dragon slayer</a></span> or <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/giant-slayer\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"giant slayer\">giant slayer</a></span> (DM’s choice) for the next 9 days. The charm then vanishes from you, and the weapon returns <span class=\"No-Break\">to normal.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Charm of Vitality. </span></strong>This charm allows you to give yourself the benefit of a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-vitality\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"potion of vitality\">potion of vitality</a></span> as an action. Once you do so, the charm vanishes<span class=\"No-Break\"> from you.</span></p><h2>Marks of Prestige</h2><p>Sometimes the most memorable reward for adventurers is the prestige that they acquire throughout a realm. Their adventures often earn them fame and power, allies and enemies, and titles that they can pass on to their descendants. Some lords and ladies began as commoners who ventured into the dangerous places of the world and made names for themselves through their br<span class=\"No-Break\">ave deeds.</span></p><p>This section details the most common marks of prestige that adventures might acquire during a campaign. These marks are usually gained along with treasure, but sometimes they stand on <span class=\"No-Break\">their own.</span></p><h3>Letters of Recommendation</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/874/c7c-11.png\"></p><p>When gold is in short supply, the adventurers’ benefactor might provide them with a letter of recommendation instead of monetary payment. Such a letter is usually enclosed in a handsome folio, case, or scroll tube for safe transport, and it usually bears the signature and seal of whoever<span class=\"No-Break\"> wrote it.</span></p><p>A letter of recommendation from a person of impeccable reputation can grant adventurers access to NPCs that they would otherwise have trouble meeting on their own, such as a duke, viceroy, or queen. Moreover, carrying such a recommendation on one’s person can help clear up “misunderstandings” with local authorities who might not otherwise take the adventurers at t<span class=\"No-Break\">heir word.</span></p><p>A letter of recommendation is worth only as much as the person who wrote it and offers no benefit in places where its writer hold<span class=\"No-Break\">s no sway.</span></p><h3>Medals</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/871/c7c-10.png\"></p><p>Although they are often fashioned from gold and other precious materials, medals have an even greater symbolic value to those who award and receive them.</p><p>Medals are typically awarded by powerful political figures for acts of heroism, and wearing a medal is usually enough to earn the respect of those who understand its significance.</p><p>Different acts of heroism can warrant different kinds of medals. The King of Breland (in the Eberron campaign setting) might award a Royal Badge of Valor (shaped like a shield and made of ruby and electrum) to adventurers for defending Brelish citizens, while the Golden Bear of Breland (a medal made of gold and shaped in a likeness of a bear’s head, with gems for eyes) might be reserved for adventurers who prove their allegiance to the Brelish Crown by uncovering and defeating a plot to end the Treaty of Thronehold and reignite the Last War.</p><p>A medal doesn’t offer a specific in-game benefit to one who wears it, but it can affect dealings with NPCs. For example, a character who proudly displays the Golden Bear of Breland will be regarded as a hero of the people within the kingdom of Breland. Outside Breland, the medal carries far less weight, except among allies of Brela<span class=\"No-Break\">nd’s king.</span></p><h3>Parcels of Land</h3><p>A parcel of land is just that, and usually comes with a royal letter affirming that the land has been granted as a reward for some service. Such land usually remains the property of the local ruler or ruling body, but is leased to a character with the understanding that it can be taken away, especially if his or her loyalty is ever called into<span class=\"No-Break\"> question.</span></p><p>A parcel of land, if sufficiently large, might have one or more farms or villages on it already, in which case the recipient is pronounced lord or lady of the land and is expected to collect taxes, along with any oth<span class=\"No-Break\">er duties.</span></p><p>A character who receives a parcel of land is free to build on it and is expected to safeguard it. He or she may yield the land as part of an inheritance, but can’t sell or trade it without permission from the local ruler or ru<span class=\"No-Break\">ling body.</span></p><p>Parcels of land make fine rewards for adventurers who are looking for a place to settle or who have family or some kind of personal investment in the region where the land i<span class=\"No-Break\">s located.</span></p><h3>Special Favors</h3><p>A reward might come in the form of a favor that the characters can call on at some future date. Special favors work best when the individual granting them is trustworthy. A lawful good or lawful neutral NPC will do whatever can be done to fulfill an obligation when the time comes, short of breaking laws. A lawful evil NPC does the same, but only because a deal is a deal. A neutral good or neutral NPC might pay off favors to protect his or her reputation. A chaotic good NPC is more concerned about doing right by the adventurers, honoring any obligations without worrying too much about personal risk or adherence t<span class=\"No-Break\">o the law.</span></p><h3>Special Rights</h3><p>A politically powerful person can reward characters by giving them special rights, which are usually articulated in some sort of official document. For example, characters might be granted special rights to carry weapons in public places, kill enemies of the crown, or negotiate on a duke’s behalf. They might earn the right to demand free room and board from any establishment within a particular community, or have the right to draft local militia to assist them <span class=\"No-Break\">as needed.</span></p><p>Special rights last only as long as the legal document dictates, and such rights can be revoked if the adventurers a<span class=\"No-Break\">buse them.</span></p><h3>Strongholds</h3><p>A stronghold is a reward usually given to seasoned adventurers who demonstrate unwavering fealty to a powerful political figure or ruling body, such as a king, a knighthood, or a council of wizards. A stronghold can be anything from a fortified tower in the heart of a city to a provincial keep on the borderlands. While the stronghold is for the characters to govern as they see fit, the land on which it sits remains the property of the crown or local ruler. Should the characters prove disloyal or unworthy of the gift, they can be asked or forced to relinquish custody of the s<span class=\"No-Break\">tronghold.</span></p><p>As an additional reward, the individual bequeathing the stronghold might offer to pay its maintenance costs for a period of one or more months, after which the characters inherit that responsibility. See <a title=\"Between Adventures\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/between-adventures\">chapter 6</a>&nbsp;for more information on stronghold ma<span class=\"No-Break\">intenance.</span></p><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/875/c7c-12.png\"></span></p><h3>Titles</h3><p>A politically powerful figure has the ability to dispense titles. A title often comes with a parcel of land (see above). For example, a character might be awarded the title Earl of Stormriver or Countess of Dun Fjord, along with a parcel of land that includes a settlement or region of the <span class=\"No-Break\">same name.</span></p><p>A character can hold more than one title, and in a feudal society, those titles can be passed down to (or distributed among) one’s children. While a character holds a title, he or she is expected to act in a manner befitting that title. By decree, titles can be stripped away if the local ruler or ruling body has reason to question the character’s loyalty or c<span class=\"No-Break\">ompetence.</span></p><h3>Training</h3><p>A character might be offered special training in lieu of a financial reward. This kind of training isn’t widely available and thus is highly desirable. It presumes the existence of a skilled trainer — perhaps a retired adventurer or champion who is willing to serve as a mentor. The trainer might be a reclusive wizard or haughty sorcerer who owes the queen a favor, the knight-commander of the King’s Guard, the leader of a powerful druid circle, a quirky monk who lives in a remote mountaintop pagoda, a barbarian chieftain, a warlock living among nomads as a fortune-teller, or an absentminded bard whose plays and poetry are known throughout<span class=\"No-Break\"> the land.</span></p><p>A character who agrees to training as a reward must spend downtime with the trainer (see <a title=\"Downtime Activities\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/between-adventures#DowntimeActivities\">chapter 6</a>&nbsp;for more information on downtime activities). In exchange, the character is guaranteed to receive a special benefit. Possible training benefits include the <span class=\"No-Break\">following:</span></p><ul>\n<li>The character gains inspiration daily at dawn for 1d4<span class=\"No-Break\"> + 6 days.</span></li>\n<li>The character gains proficiency i<span class=\"No-Break\">n a skill.</span></li>\n<li>The character gai<span class=\"No-Break\">ns a feat.</span></li>\n</ul><h2>Epic Boons</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/873/c7c-13.png\"></p><p>An epic boon is a special power available only to 20th level characters. Characters at that level gain such boons only if you want them to and only when you feel it’s appropriate. Epic boons are best awarded after the characters complete a major quest, or accomplish something else particularly notable. A character might gain an epic boon after destroying an evil artifact, defeating an ancient dragon, or halting an incursion from the Out<span class=\"No-Break\">er Planes.</span></p><p>Epic boons can also be used as a form of advancement, a way to provide greater power to characters who have no more levels to gain. With this approach, consider awarding one epic boon to each character for every 30,000 XP he or she earns above 3<span class=\"No-Break\">55,000 XP.</span></p><p>You determine which epic boon a character gains. Ideally, the boon you pick is something the character would put to use in future adventures. You can allow a player to select a boon for his or her character, subject to your<span class=\"No-Break\"> approval.</span></p><p>Whatever boon a character ends up with, consider its place in your story and world. Many of the boons are extraordinary and represent the gradual transformation of a character into something resembling a demigod. The acquisition of a boon might visibly transform a character. For example, the eyes of a character with the Boon of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Truesight\">Truesight</a> might glow when he or she feels strong emotion, and a character who has the Boon of High Magic might have faint motes of light glimmering around his or her head. Also, decide how the boon first appears. Does the boon appear spontaneously and mysteriously? Or does a being of cosmic power manifest to bestow it? The bestowal of a boon can itself be an exciting scene in an <span class=\"No-Break\">adventure.</span></p><p>The text of a boon addresses its user. Unless a boon says otherwise, a character can’t gain it more <span class=\"No-Break\">than once.</span></p><h3>Boon of Combat Prowess</h3><p>When you miss with a melee weapon attack, you can choose to hit instead. Once you use this boon, you can’t use it again until you finish a s<span class=\"No-Break\">hort rest.</span></p><h3>Boon of Dimensional Travel</h3><p>As an action, you can cast the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/misty-step\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"misty step\">misty step</a></span> spell, without using a spell slot or any components. Once you do so, you can’t use this boon again until you finish a s<span class=\"No-Break\">hort rest.</span></p><h3>Boon of Fate</h3><p>When another creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw, you can roll a d10 and apply the result as a bonus or penalty to the roll.

Once you use this boon, you can’t use it again until you finish a s<span class=\"No-Break\">hort rest.</span></p><h3>Boon of Quick Casting</h3><p>Choose one of your spells of 1st through 3rd level that has a casting time of 1 action. That spell’s casting time is now 1 bonus actio<span class=\"No-Break\">n for you.</span></p><h3>Boon of Recovery</h3><p>You can use a bonus action to regain a number of hit points equal to half your hit point maximum. Once you use this boon, you can’t use it again until you finish a <span class=\"No-Break\">long rest.</span></p><h3>Boon of Resilience</h3><p>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagica<span class=\"No-Break\">l weapons.</span></p><h3>Boon of Skill Proficiency</h3><p>You gain proficiency in a<span class=\"No-Break\">ll skills.</span></p><h3>Boon of Speed</h3><p>Your walking speed increases b<span class=\"No-Break\">y 30 feet.</span></p><p>In addition, you can use a bonus action to take the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash\">Dash</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Disengage\">Disengage</a> action. Once you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a s<span class=\"No-Break\">hort rest.</span></p><h3>Boon of Spell Mastery</h3><p>Choose one 1st-level sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell that you can cast.

{"name":" 13 Chapter 8: Running the Game","permission":{"default":0,"DJNYgTCLxATVgLjS":3},"flags":{"vtta":{"name":"13 Chapter 8: Running the Game","sceneId":null}},"content":"<h1>Chapter 8: Running the Game</h1><p><span class=\"Epigraph-Small-Cap\">Rules enable you and your players to have </span>fun at the table. The rules serve you, not vice versa. There are the rules of the game, and there are table rules for how the game is played. For instance, players need to know what happens when one of them misses a session. They need to know whether to bring miniatures, any special rules you’ve decided to use, and how to treat a cocked die (a die that lands so that its face can’t be clearly read). These topics and more are covered in thi<span class=\"No-Break\">s chapter.</span></p><h2>Table Rules</h2><p>Ideally, players come to the gaming table with the same goal: to have a fun time together. This section gives recommendations for table rules you can establish to help meet that goal. Here are some fun<span class=\"No-Break\">damentals:</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Foster respect.</span></strong> Don’t bring personal conflicts to the table or let disagreements escalate into bad feelings. Don’t touch others’ dice if they’re sensitive<span class=\"No-Break\"> about it.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Avoid distractions.</span></strong> Turn off the television and video games. If you have young children, hire a babysitter. Reducing distractions helps players stay in character and enjoy the story. It might be fine to have players wandering away from the table and back, but some players prefer plann<span class=\"No-Break\">ed breaks.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Have snacks.</span></strong> Decide before a session who will bring food and drink. This is often something the players c<span class=\"No-Break\">an handle.</span></p><h3>Table Talk</h3><p>Set expectations about how players talk at <span class=\"No-Break\">the table:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Make it clear who’s speaking: the character or the player (out of c<span class=\"No-Break\">haracter).</span></li>\n<li>Decide how you feel about a player sharing information that his or her character wouldn’t know or that the character is incapable of sharing as a result of being <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\">unconscious</a>, dead, or<span class=\"No-Break\"> far away.</span></li>\n<li>Are you all right with players retracting what they just said their chara<span class=\"No-Break\">cters did?</span></li>\n</ul><h3>Dice Rolling</h3><p>Establish expectations about rolling dice. Rolling in full view of everyone is a good starting point. If you see a player rolling and scooping the dice up before anyone else can see, encourage that player to be less <span class=\"No-Break\">secretive.</span></p><p>When a die falls on the floor, do you count it or reroll it? When it lands cocked against a book, do you pull the book away and see where it lands, or <span class=\"No-Break\">reroll it?</span></p><p>What about you, the DM? Do you make your rolls in the open or hide them behind a DM screen? Consider the <span class=\"No-Break\">following:</span></p><ul>\n<li>If you roll dice where the players can see, they know you’re playing impartially and not fudg<span class=\"No-Break\">ing rolls.</span></li>\n<li>Rolling behind a screen keeps the players guessing about the strength of their opposition. When a monster hits all the time, is it of a much higher level than the characters, or are you rolling hig<span class=\"No-Break\">h numbers?</span></li>\n<li>Rolling behind a screen lets you fudge the results if you want to. If two critical hits in a row would kill a character, you could change the second critical hit into a normal hit, or even a miss. Don’t distort die rolls too often, though, and don’t let on that you’re doing it. Otherwise, your players might think they don’t face any real risks — or worse, that you’re playing <span class=\"No-Break\">favorites.</span></li>\n<li>A roll behind a screen can help preserve mystery. For example, if a player thinks there might be someone <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible\">invisible</a> nearby and makes a Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) check, consider rolling a die behind the screen even if no one is there, making the player think someone is, indeed, hiding. Try not to overuse t<span class=\"No-Break\">his trick.</span></li>\n<li>You might choose to make a roll for a player because you don’t want the player to know how good the check total is. For example, if a player suspects a baroness might be <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a> and wants to make a Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Insight\">Insight</a>) check, you could make the roll in secret for the player. If the player rolled and got a high number but didn’t sense anything amiss, the player would be confident that the baroness wasn’t <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a>. With a low roll, a negative answer wouldn’t mean much. A hidden roll allows un<span class=\"No-Break\">certainty.</span></li>\n</ul><h3>Rolling Attacks and Damage</h3><p>Players are accustomed to rolling an attack roll first and then a damage roll. If players make attack rolls and damage rolls at the same time, the action moves a little faster around <span class=\"No-Break\">the table.</span></p><h3>Rules Discussions</h3><p>You might need to set a policy on rules discussions at the table. Some groups don’t mind putting the game on hold while they hash out different interpretations of a rule. Others prefer to let the DM make a call and continue with the action. If you gloss over a rules issue in play, make a note of it (a good task to delegate to a player) and return to the is<span class=\"No-Break\">sue later.</span></p><h3>Metagame Thinking</h3><p>Metagame thinking means thinking about the game as a<span class=\"italic\"> game.</span> It’s like when a character in a movie knows it’s a movie and acts accordingly. For example, a player might say, “The DM wouldn’t throw such a powerful monster at us!” or you might hear, “The read-aloud text spent a lot of time describing that door — let’s search <span class=\"No-Break\">it again!”</span></p><p>Discourage metagame thinking by giving players a gentle reminder: “What do your <span class=\"italic\">characters</span> think?” You can curb metagame thinking by setting up situations that will be difficult for the characters and that might require negotiation or retreat t<span class=\"No-Break\">o survive.</span></p><h3>Missing Players</h3><p>How should you deal with the characters of missing players? Consider thes<span class=\"No-Break\">e options:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Have another player run the missing player’s character. The player running the extra character should strive to keep the character alive and use resourc<span class=\"No-Break\">es wisely.</span></li>\n<li>Run the character yourself. It’s an extra burden for you, but it<span class=\"No-Break\"> can work.</span></li>\n<li>Decide the character isn’t there. Invent a good reason for the character to miss the adventure, perhaps by having him or her linger in town or continue a downtime activity. Leave a way for the character to rejoin the party when the playe<span class=\"No-Break\">r returns.</span></li>\n<li>Have the character fade into the background. This solution requires everyone to step out of the game world a bit and suspend disbelief, but might be the easiest solution. You act as if the character’s not there, but don’t try to come up with any in-game explanation for this absence. Monsters don’t attack the character, who returns the favor. On returning, the player resumes playing as if he or she was n<span class=\"No-Break\">ever gone.</span></li>\n</ul><h3>Small Groups</h3><p>Most of the time, each player runs one character. The game plays best that way, without overwhelming anyone. But if your group is small, players can control more than one character. Or you can fill out the group with NPC followers, using the guidelines in chapter 4, \"<a title=\"Creating Nonplayer Characters\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters\">Creating Nonplayer Characters</a>.\" You can also make the characters more resilient by using the healing surge option in chapter 9, \"<a title=\"Healing Surge\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#HealingSurge\">Dungeon Master’s </a><span class=\"No-Break\"><a title=\"Healing Surge\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#HealingSurge\">Workshop</a>.\"</span></p><p>Don’t force a reluctant player to take on multiple characters, and don’t show favoritism by allowing only one player to do so. If one character is the mentor of the other, the player can focus on roleplaying just one character. Otherwise, players can end up awkwardly talking to themselves in character, or avoiding roleplaying a<span class=\"No-Break\">ltogether.</span></p><p>Multiple characters can be a good idea in a game that features nonstop peril and a high rate of character death. If your group agrees to the premise, have each player keep one or two additional characters on hand, ready to jump in whenever the current character dies. Each time the main character gains a level, the backup characters d<span class=\"No-Break\">o as well.</span></p><h3>New Players</h3><p>When a new player joins the group, allow the new player to create a character of a level equal to the lowest-level member of the party. The only exception to this guideline is when the new player is completely unfamiliar with the D&amp;D game. In that case, have that player start with a 1st-level character. If the rest of the party is significantly higher in level, consider taking a short break from the campaign and having everyone play a 1st-level character for a few sessions while the new player learns <span class=\"No-Break\">the ropes.</span></p><p>Integrating a new character into the group can be difficult if the party is in the middle of an adventure. The following approaches can help make <span class=\"No-Break\">it easier:</span></p><ul>\n<li>The new character is a friend or relative of one of the adventurers who has been searching for <span class=\"No-Break\">the group.</span></li>\n<li>The new character is a prisoner of the foes the other characters are fighting. When rescued, this character joins th<span class=\"No-Break\">eir group.</span></li>\n<li>The new character is the sole survivor of another adventur<span class=\"No-Break\">ing group.</span></li>\n</ul><h2>The Role of Dice</h2><p>Dice are neutral arbiters. They can determine the outcome of an action without assigning any motivation to the DM and without playing favorites. The extent to which you use them is entirely <span class=\"No-Break\">up to you.</span></p><h3>Rolling with It</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/876/c8-02.png\"></p><p>Some DMs rely on die rolls for almost everything. When a character attempts a task, the DM calls for a check and picks a DC. As a DM using this style, you can’t rely on the characters succeeding or failing on any one check to move the action in a specific direction. You must be ready to improvise and react to a changing <span class=\"No-Break\">situation.</span></p><p>Relying on dice also gives the players the sense that anything is possible. Sure, it might seem unlikely that the party’s halfling can leap on the ogre’s back, pull a sack over its head, and then dive to safety, but with a lucky enough roll it just m<span class=\"No-Break\">ight work.</span></p><p>A drawback of this approach is that roleplaying can diminish if players feel that their die rolls, rather than their decisions and characterizations, always determin<span class=\"No-Break\">e success.</span></p><h3>Ignoring the Dice</h3><p>One approach is to use dice as rarely as possible. Some DMs use them only during combat, and determine success or failure as they like in other s<span class=\"No-Break\">ituations.</span></p><p>With this approach, the DM decides whether an action or a plan succeeds or fails based on how well the players make their case, how thorough or creative they are, or other factors. For example, the players might describe how they search for a secret door, detailing how they tap on a wall or twist a torch sconce to find its trigger. That could be enough to convince the DM that they find the secret door without having to make an ability check<span class=\"No-Break\"> to do so.</span></p><p>This approach rewards creativity by encouraging players to look to the situation you’ve described for an answer, rather than looking to their character sheet or their character’s special abilities. A downside is that no DM is completely neutral. A DM might come to favor certain players or approaches, or even work against good ideas if they send the game in a direction he or she doesn’t like. This approach can also slow the game if the DM focuses on one “correct” action that the characters must describe to overcome an<span class=\"No-Break\"> obstacle.</span></p><h3>The Middle Path</h3><p>Many DMs find that using a combination of the two approaches works best. By balancing the use of dice against deciding on success, you can encourage your players to strike a balance between relying on their bonuses and abilities and paying attention to the game and immersing themselves in <span class=\"No-Break\">its world.</span></p><p>Remember that dice don’t run your game — you do. Dice are like rules. They’re tools to help keep the action moving. At any time, you can decide that a player’s action is automatically successful. You can also grant the player advantage on any ability check, reducing the chance of a bad die roll foiling the character’s plans. By the same token, a bad plan or unfortunate circumstances can transform the easiest task into an impossibility, or at least impose dis<span class=\"No-Break\">advantage.</span></p><h2>Using Ability Scores</h2><p>When a player wants to do something, it’s often appropriate to let the attempt succeed without a roll or a reference to the character’s ability scores. For example, a character doesn’t normally need to make a Dexterity check to walk across an empty room or a Charisma check to order a mug of ale. Only call for a roll if there is a meaningful consequence fo<span class=\"No-Break\">r failure.</span></p><p>When deciding whether to use a roll, ask yourself two <span class=\"No-Break\">questions:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Is a task so easy and so free of conflict and stress that there should be no chance o<span class=\"No-Break\">f failure?</span></li>\n<li>Is a task so inappropriate or impossible — such as hitting the moon with an arrow — that it c<span class=\"No-Break\">an’t work?</span></li>\n</ul><p>If the answer to both of these questions is no, some kind of roll is appropriate. The following sections provide guidance on determining whether to call for an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw; how to assign DCs; when to use advantage and disadvantage; and other relat<span class=\"No-Break\">ed topics.</span></p><h3>Ability Checks</h3><p>An ability check is a test to see whether a character succeeds at a task that he or she has decided to attempt. The <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em> includes examples of what each ability score is used for. The Ability Checks table summarizes that material for easy <span class=\"No-Break\">reference.</span></p><h4>Multiple Ability Checks</h4><p>Sometimes a character fails an ability check and wants to try again. In some cases, a character is free to do so; the only real cost is the time it takes. With enough attempts and enough time, a character should eventually succeed at the task. To speed things up, assume that a character spending ten times the normal amount of time needed to complete a task automatically succeeds at that task. However, no amount of repeating the check allows a character to turn an impossible task into a succe<span class=\"No-Break\">ssful one.</span></p><p>In other cases, failing an ability check makes it impossible to make the same check to do the same thing again. For example, a rogue might try to trick a town guard into thinking the adventurers are undercover agents of the king. If the rogue loses a contest of Charisma (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Deception\">Deception</a>) against the guard’s Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Insight\">Insight</a>), the same lie told again won’t work. The characters can come up with a different way to get past the guard or try the check again against another guard at a different gate. But you might decide that the initial failure makes those checks more difficult to<span class=\"No-Break\"> pull off.</span></p><h4>Contests</h4><p>A contest is a kind of ability check that matches two creatures against each other. Use a contest if a character attempts something that either directly foils or is directly opposed by another creature’s efforts. In a contest, the ability checks are compared to each other, rather than to a targ<span class=\"No-Break\">et number.</span></p><p>When you call for a contest, you pick the ability that each side must use, deciding whether both sides use the same ability or whether different abilities should counter each other. For example, when a creature tries to hide, it engages in a contest of Dexterity against Wisdom. But if two creatures arm wrestle, or if one creature is holding a door closed against another’s attempt to push it open, both use<span class=\"No-Break\"> Strength.</span></p><h5>Ability Checks</h5><div><table class=\"rtg-medium-header-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Ability</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Used for …</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Example Uses</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Strength</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Physical force and athleticism</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Smash down a door, move a boulder, use a spike to wedge a door shut</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Dexterity</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Agility, reflexes, and balance</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Sneak past a guard, walk along a narrow ledge, wriggle free from chains</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Constitution</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Stamina and health</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Endure a marathon, grasp hot metal without flinching, win a drinking contest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Intelligence</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Memory and reason</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Recall a bit of lore, recognize a clue’s significance, decode an encrypted message</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wisdom</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Perceptiveness and willpower</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Spot a hidden creature, sense that someone is lying</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Charisma</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Social influence and confidence</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Persuade a creature to do something, cow a crowd, lie to someone convincingly</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><blockquote>\n<p><strong>INTELLIGENCE CHECK VS. WISDOM CHECK</strong></p>\n<p>If you have trouble deciding whether to call for an Intelligence or a Wisdom check to determine whether a character notices something, think of it in terms of what a very high or low score in those two abilities m<span class=\"No-Break\">ight mean.</span></p>\n<p>A character with a high Wisdom but low Intelligence is aware of the surroundings but is bad at interpreting what things mean. The character might spot that one section of a wall is clean and dusty compared to the others, but he or she wouldn’t necessarily make the deduction that a secret door<span class=\"No-Break\"> is there.</span></p>\n<p>In contrast, a character with high Intelligence and low Wisdom is probably oblivious but clever. The character might not spot the clean section of wall but, if asked about it, could immediately deduce why i<span class=\"No-Break\">t’s clean.</span></p>\n<p>Wisdom checks allow characters to perceive what is around them (the wall is clean here), while Intelligence checks answer why things are that way (there’s probably a sec<span class=\"No-Break\">ret door).</span></p>\n</blockquote><h3>Attack Rolls</h3><p>Call for an attack roll when a character tries to hit a creature or an object with an attack, especially when the attack could be foiled by the target’s armor or shield or by another object providing cover. You can also use attack rolls to resolve noncombat activities such as archery contests or a game<span class=\"No-Break\"> of darts.</span></p><h3>Saving Throws</h3><p>A saving throw is an instant response to a harmful effect and is almost never done by choice. A save makes the most sense when something bad happens to a character and the character has a chance to avoid that effect. An ability check is something a character actively attempts to accomplish, whereas a saving throw is a split-second response to the activity of someone or somet<span class=\"No-Break\">hing else.</span></p><p>Most of the time, a saving throw comes into play when an effect — such as a spell, monster ability, or trap — calls for it, telling you what kind of saving throw is involved and providing a <span class=\"No-Break\">DC for it.</span></p><p>Other times, a situation arises that clearly calls for a saving throw, especially when a character is subjected to a harmful effect that can’t be hedged out by armor or a shield. It’s up to you to decide which ability score is involved. The Saving Throws table offers su<span class=\"No-Break\">ggestions.</span></p><h5>Saving Throws</h5><div><table class=\"rtg-medium-header-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Ability</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Used For …</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Strength</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Opposing a force that would physically move or bind you</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Dexterity</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Dodging out of harm’s way</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Constitution</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Enduring a disease, poison, or other hazard that saps vitality</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Intelligence</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Disbelieving certain illusions and resisting mental assaults that can be refuted with logic, sharp memory, or both</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wisdom</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Resisting effects that charm, frighten, or otherwise assault your willpower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Charisma</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Withstanding effects, such as possession, that would subsume your personality or hurl you to another plane of existence</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h3>Difficulty Class</h3><p>It’s your job to establish the Difficulty Class for an ability check or a saving throw when a rule or an adventure doesn’t give you one. Sometimes you’ll even want to change such established DCs. When you do so, think of how difficult a task is and then pick the associated DC from the Typical <span class=\"No-Break\">DCs table.</span></p><h5>Typical DCs</h5><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Task</th>\n<th>DC</th>\n<th>Task</th>\n<th>DC</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Very easy</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Hard</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Easy</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>Very hard</td>\n<td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>Nearly impossible</td>\n<td>30</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p>The numbers associated with these categories of difficulty are meant to be easy to keep in your head, so that you don’t have to refer to these rules every time you decide on a DC. Here are some tips for using DC categories at the gam<span class=\"No-Break\">ing table.</span></p><p>If you’ve decided that an ability check is called for, then most likely the task at hand isn’t a <strong><span class=\"bold\">very easy</span></strong> one. Most people can accomplish a DC 5 task with little chance of failure. Unless circumstances are unusual, let characters succeed at such a task without makin<span class=\"No-Break\">g a check.</span></p><p>Then ask yourself, “Is this task’s difficulty easy, moderate, or hard?” If the only DCs you ever use are 10, 15, and 20, your game will run just fine. Keep in mind that a character with a 10 in the associated ability and no proficiency will succeed at an <strong><span class=\"bold\">easy</span></strong> task around 50 percent of the time. A <strong><span class=\"bold\">moderate</span></strong> task requires a higher score or proficiency for success, whereas a <strong><span class=\"bold\">hard</span></strong> task typically requires both. A big dose of luck with the d20 also doe<span class=\"No-Break\">sn’t hurt.</span></p><p>If you find yourself thinking, “This task is especially hard,” you can use a higher DC, but do so with caution and consider the level of the characters. A DC 25 task is <strong><span class=\"bold\">very hard</span></strong> for low-level characters to accomplish, but it becomes more reasonable after 10th level or so. A DC 30 check is <strong><span class=\"bold\">nearly impossible</span></strong> for most low-level characters. A 20th-level character with proficiency and a relevant ability score of 20 still needs a 19 or 20 on the die roll to succeed at a task of this d<span class=\"No-Break\">ifficulty.</span></p><h4>Variant: Automatic Success</h4><p>Sometimes the randomness of a d20 roll leads to ludicrous results. Let’s say a door requires a successful DC 15 Strength check to be battered down. A fighter with a Strength of 20 might helplessly flail against the door because of bad die rolls. Meanwhile, the rogue with a Strength of 10 rolls a 20 and knocks the door from i<span class=\"No-Break\">ts hinges</span><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><p>If such results bother you, consider allowing automatic success on certain checks. Under this optional rule, a character automatically succeeds on any ability check with a DC less than or equal to the relevant ability score minus 5. So in the example above, the fighter would automatically kick in the door. This rule doesn’t apply to contests, saving throws, or att<span class=\"No-Break\">ack rolls.</span></p><p>Having proficiency with a skill or tool can also grant automatic success. If a character’s proficiency bonus applies to his or her ability check, the character automatically succeeds if the DC is 10 or less. If that character is 11th level or higher, the check succeeds if the DC is 1<span class=\"No-Break\">5 or less.</span></p><p>The downside of this whole approach is its predictability. For example, once a character’s ability score reaches 20, checks of DC 15 and lower using that ability become automatic successes. Smart players will then always match the character with the highest ability score against any given check. If you want some risk of failure, you need to set higher DCs. Doing this, though, can aggravate the problem you’re trying to solve: higher DCs require higher die rolls, and thus rely even mor<span class=\"No-Break\">e on luck.</span></p><h3>Proficiency</h3><p>When you ask a player to make an ability check, consider whether a skill or tool proficiency might apply to it. The player might also ask you if a particular proficienc<span class=\"No-Break\">y applies.</span></p><p>One way to think about this question is to consider whether a character could become better at a particular task through training and practice. If the answer is no, it’s fine to say that no proficiency applies. But if the answer is yes, assign an appropriate skill or tool proficiency to reflect that training and<span class=\"No-Break\"> practice.</span></p><h4>Skills</h4><p>As described in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em>, a skill proficiency represents a character’s focus on one aspect of an ability. Among all the things a character’s Dexterity score describes, the character might be particularly skilled at sneaking around, reflected in proficiency in the skill. When that skill is used for an ability check, it is usually used with <span class=\"No-Break\">Dexterity.</span></p><p>Under certain circumstances, you can decide a character’s proficiency in a skill can be applied to a different ability check. For example, you might decide that a character forced to swim from an island to the mainland must succeed on a Constitution check (as opposed to a Strength check) because of the distance involved. The character is proficient in the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a> skill, which covers swimming, so you allow the character’s proficiency bonus to apply to this ability check. In effect, you’re asking for a Constitution (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) check, instead of a Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) check.</p><p>Often, players ask whether they can apply a skill proficiency to an ability check. If a player can provide a good justification for why a character’s training and aptitude in a skill should apply to the check, go ahead and allow it, rewarding the player’s creative<span class=\"No-Break\"> thinking.</span></p><h4>Tools</h4><p>Having proficiency with a tool allows you to apply your proficiency bonus to an ability check you make using that tool. For example, a character proficient with carpenter’s tools can apply his or her proficiency bonus to a Dexterity check to craft a wooden flute, an Intelligence check to craft a wooden secret door, or a Strength check to build a working trebuchet. However, the proficiency bonus wouldn’t apply to an ability check made to identify unsafe wooden construction or to discern the origin of a crafted item, since neither check requires<span class=\"No-Break\"> tool use.</span></p><h4>Saving Throws and Attack Rolls</h4><p>Characters are either proficient with a saving throw or attack, or they aren’t. The bonus always applies if a character is p<span class=\"No-Break\">roficient.</span></p><h3>Advantage and Disadvantage</h3><p>Advantage and disadvantage are among the most useful tools in your DM’s toolbox. They reflect temporary circumstances that might affect the chances of a character succeeding or failing at a task. Advantage is also a great way to reward a player who shows exceptional creativit<span class=\"No-Break\">y in play.</span></p><p>Characters often gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, spells, or other features of their classes or backgrounds. In other cases, you decide whether a circumstance influences a roll in one direction or another, and you grant advantage or impose disadvantage as<span class=\"No-Break\"> a result.</span></p><p>Consider granting <strong><span class=\"bold\">advant</span><span class=\"No-Break\"><span class=\"bold\">age</span></span></strong><span class=\"No-Break\"> when …</span></p><ul>\n<li>Circumstances not related to a creature’s inherent capabilities provide it wit<span class=\"No-Break\">h an edge.</span></li>\n<li>Some aspect of the environment contributes to the character’s chance o<span class=\"No-Break\">f success.</span></li>\n<li>A player shows exceptional creativity or cunning in attempting or describi<span class=\"No-Break\">ng a task.</span></li>\n<li>Previous actions (whether taken by the character making the attempt or some other creature) improve the chances o<span class=\"No-Break\">f success.</span></li>\n</ul><p>Consider imposing <strong><span class=\"bold\">disadvant</span><span class=\"No-Break\"><span class=\"bold\">age</span></span></strong><span class=\"No-Break\"> when …</span></p><ul>\n<li>Circumstances hinder success in<span class=\"No-Break\"> some way.</span></li>\n<li>Some aspect of the environment makes success less likely (assuming that aspect doesn’t already impose a penalty to the roll be<span class=\"No-Break\">ing made).</span></li>\n<li>An element of the plan or description of an action makes success le<span class=\"No-Break\">ss likely.</span></li>\n</ul><p>Because advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out, there’s no need to keep track of how many circumstances weigh on b<span class=\"No-Break\">oth sides.</span></p><p>For example, imagine a wizard is running down a dungeon corridor to escape from a <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/beholder\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"beholder\">beholder</a>. Around the corner ahead, two <span class=\"plural-monster-tooltip\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ogre\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"ogre\">ogre</a>s</strong></span> lie in wait. Does the wizard hear the <span class=\"plural-monster-tooltip\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ogre\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"ogre\">ogre</a>s</strong></span> readying their ambush? You look at the wizard’s passive Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) score and consider all the factors weigh<span class=\"No-Break\">ing on it.</span></p><p>The wizard is running, not paying attention to what’s ahead of him. This imposes disadvantage on the wizard’s ability check. However, the <span class=\"plural-monster-tooltip\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ogre\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"ogre\">ogre</a>s</strong></span> are readying a portcullis trap and making a lot of noise with a winch, which could grant the wizard advantage on the check. As a result, the character has neither advantage nor disadvantage on the Wisdom check, and you don’t need to consider any additional factors. Past encounters with an <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ogre\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"ogre\">ogre</a> ambush, the fact that the wizard’s ears are still ringing from the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/thunderwave\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"thunderwave\">thunderwave</a></span> spell he cast at the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/beholder\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"beholder\">beholder</a>, the overall noise level of the dungeon — none of that matters any more. They all c<span class=\"No-Break\">ancel out.</span></p><h3>Inspiration</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/900/c8-03.png\"></p><p>Awarding inspiration is an effective way to encourage roleplaying and risk-taking. As explained in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em>, having inspiration gives a character an obvious benefit: being able to gain advantage on one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Remember that a character can have no more than one inspiration <span class=\"No-Break\">at a time.</span></p><h4>Awarding Inspiration</h4><p>Think of inspiration as a spice that you can use to enhance your campaign. Some DMs forgo using inspiration, while others embrace it as a key part of the game. If you take away anything from this section, remember this golden rule: inspiration should make the game more enjoyable for everyone. Award inspiration when players take actions that make the game more exciting, amusing, or <span class=\"No-Break\">memorable.</span></p><p>As a rule of thumb, aim to award inspiration to each character about once per session of play. Over time, you might want to award inspiration more or less often, at a rate that works best for your table. You might use the same rate for your entire DMing career, or you might change it with each<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><p>Offering inspiration as a reward encourages certain types of behavior in your players. Think of your style as a DM and your group’s preferences. What helps make the game more fun for your group? What type of actions fit in with your campaign’s style or genre? Your answers to those questions help determine when you award in<span class=\"No-Break\">spiration.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Roleplaying.</span></strong> Using inspiration to reward roleplaying is a good place to start for most groups. Reward a player with inspiration when that player causes his or her character to do something that is consistent with the character’s personality trait, flaw, or bond. The character’s action should be notable in some way. It might drive the story forward, push the adventurers into danger, or make everyone at the table laugh. In essence, you reward the player for roleplaying in a way that makes the game more enjoyable for ever<span class=\"No-Break\">yone else.</span></p><p>Take into account each player’s roleplaying style, and try not to favor one style over another. For example, Allison might be comfortable speaking in an accent and adopting her character’s mannerisms, but Paul feels self-conscious when trying to act and prefers to describe his character’s attitude and actions. Neither style is better than the other. Inspiration encourages players to take part and make a good effort, and awarding it fairly makes the game better for<span class=\"No-Break\"> everyone.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Heroism.</span></strong> You can use inspiration to encourage player characters to take risks. A fighter might not normally hurl himself over a balcony to land in the midst of a pack of hungry ghouls, but you can reward the character’s daring maneuver with inspiration. Such a reward tells the players that you want them to embrace swashbuckli<span class=\"No-Break\">ng action.</span></p><p>This approach is great for campaigns that emphasize action-packed heroics. For such campaigns, consider allowing inspiration to be spent after a d20 roll, rather than before. This approach turns inspiration into a cushion against failure — and a guarantee that it comes into play only when a player is faced directly by failure. Such an assurance makes risky tactics less<span class=\"No-Break\"> daunting.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">A Reward for Victory.</span></strong> Some DMs prefer to play an impartial role in their campaigns. Inspiration normally requires a DM’s judgment to award, which might run against your style if you like a campaign where you let dice determine most outcomes. If that’s your style, consider using inspiration as a reward when the characters achieve an important goal or victory, representing a surge of confidence a<span class=\"No-Break\">nd energy.</span></p><p>Under this model, give everyone in the party inspiration if the characters manage to defeat a powerful foe, execute a cunning plan to achieve a goal, or otherwise overcome a daunting obstacle in the<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Genre Emulation.</span></strong> Inspiration is a handy tool for reinforcing the conventions of a particular genre. Under this approach, think of the motifs of a genre as personality traits, flaws, and bonds that can apply to any of the adventurers. For example, in a campaign inspired by film noir, characters could have an additional flaw: “I can’t resist helping a person I find alluring despite warnings that he or she is nothing but trouble.” If the characters agree to help a suspicious but seductive noble and thereby become entangled in a web of intrigue and betrayal, reward them with in<span class=\"No-Break\">spiration.</span></p><p>Similarly, characters in a horror story typically can’t help but spend a night in a haunted house to learn its secrets. They probably also go off alone when they shouldn’t. If the party splits up, consider giving each character in<span class=\"No-Break\">spiration.</span></p><p>A sensible person would avoid the noble’s intrigues and the haunted house, but in film noir or horror, we’re not dealing with sensible people; we’re dealing with protagonists in a particular type of story. For this approach to work, create a list of your genre’s main conventions and share it with your players. Before the campaign begins, talk about the list to make sure your group is on board for embracing those co<span class=\"No-Break\">nventions.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Players and Inspiration.</span></strong> Remember that a player with inspiration can award it to another player. Some groups even like to treat inspiration as a group resource, deciding collectively when to spend it on a roll. It’s best to let players award their inspiration as they see fit, but feel free to talk to them about following certain guidelines, particularly if you’re trying to reinforce conventions of a cert<span class=\"No-Break\">ain genre.</span></p><h4>When Do You Award Inspiration?</h4><p>Consider the timing of your inspiration rewards. Some DMs like to award inspiration in response to an action. Other DMs like to encourage specific actions by offering inspiration while a player is considering options. Both approaches have their strengths and w<span class=\"No-Break\">eaknesses.</span></p><p>Waiting until after an action preserves the flow of play, but it also means players don’t know whether their decisions will earn them inspiration. It also means the player can’t spend the inspiration on the act that earned it, unless you allow a player to retroactively spend it or are quick enough to award it before any rolls. This approach works best for groups that want to focus on immersion and player agency, where the DM steps back and gives the players more freedom to do what <span class=\"No-Break\">they want.</span></p><p>Telling a player that an action will earn inspiration provides clarity, but it can make it feel like you are manipulating the players or making choices for them. Offering inspiration before an action works great with groups that are comfortable with an emphasis on genre emulation and group storytelling, where character freedom isn’t as important as weaving a compelling tale<span class=\"No-Break\"> together.</span></p><p>Start with awarding inspiration after an action, especially for your first campaign or when playing with a new group. That approach is the least disruptive to the flow of play and avoids making the players feel as if you are being man<span class=\"No-Break\">ipulative.</span></p><h4>Tracking Inspiration</h4><p>A player typically notes on a character sheet whether he or she has inspiration, or you can use poker chips or some other token Alternatively, you can hand out special d20s to represent inspiration. When a player spends inspiration, he or she rolls the die and then hands it back to you. If the player instead gives the inspiration to someone else, the d20 can go to that oth<span class=\"No-Break\">er person.</span></p><h4>Ignoring Inspiration</h4><p>Inspiration might not work for your campaign. Some DMs feel it adds a layer of metagame thinking, and others feel that heroism, roleplaying, and other parts of the game are their own rewards that don’t need incentives like in<span class=\"No-Break\">spiration.</span></p><p>If you choose to ignore inspiration, you’re telling the players that your campaign is one where you let the dice fall where they may. It’s a good option for gritty campaigns or ones where the DM focuses on playing an impartial role as a rule<span class=\"No-Break\">s arbiter.</span></p><h4>Variant: Only Players Award Inspiration</h4><p>As a DM, you have a lot to track during the game. Sometimes you can lose track of inspiration and forget to award it. As a variant rule, you can allow the players to handle awarding inspiration entirely. During every session, each player can award inspiration to another player. A player follows whatever guidelines the group has agreed on for awarding in<span class=\"No-Break\">spiration.</span></p><p>This approach makes your life easier and also gives players the chance to recognize each other for good play. You still need to make sure that inspiration is being award<span class=\"No-Break\">ed fairly.</span></p><p>This approach works best with groups that are focused on the story. It falls flat if the players merely manipulate it to gain advantage in key situations, without earning inspiration by way of good roleplaying or whatever other criteria the group has es<span class=\"No-Break\">tablished.</span></p><p>In this variant, you can allow each player to award inspiration more than once per session. If you do so, the first time that a player awards inspiration in a session is free. Whenever that player awards it later in the same session, you gain inspiration that you can spend to give advantage to any foe of the player characters. There’s no limit to the number of inspirations you can gain in this way, and unspent inspiration carries over from one session to<span class=\"No-Break\"> the next.</span></p><h3>Resolution and Consequences</h3><p>You determine the consequences of attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. In most cases, doing so is straightforward. When an attack hits, it deals damage. When a creature fails a saving throw, the creature suffers a harmful effect. When an ability check equals or exceeds the DC, the check<span class=\"No-Break\"> succeeds.</span></p><p>As a DM, you have a variety of flourishes and approaches you can take when adjudicating success and failure to make things a little less black-<span class=\"No-Break\">and-white.</span></p><h4>Success at a Cost</h4><p>Failure can be tough, but the agony is compounded when a character fails by the barest margin. When a character fails a roll by only 1 or 2, you can allow the character to succeed at the cost of a complication or hindrance. Such complications can run along any of the follow<span class=\"No-Break\">ing lines:</span></p><ul>\n<li>A character manages to get her sword past a hobgoblin’s defenses and turn a near miss into a hit, but the hobgoblin twists its shield and di<span class=\"No-Break\">sarms her.</span></li>\n<li>A character narrowly escapes the full brunt of a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"fireball\">fireball</a></span> but ends<span class=\"No-Break\"> up <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a>.</span></li>\n<li>A character fails to intimidate a kobold prisoner, but the kobold reveals its secrets anyway while shrieking at the top of its lungs, alerting other nearby<span class=\"No-Break\"> monsters.</span></li>\n<li>A character manages to finish an arduous climb to the top of a cliff despite slipping, only to realize that the rope on which his companions dangle below him is close to<span class=\"No-Break\"> breaking.</span></li>\n</ul><p>When you introduce costs such as these, try to make them obstacles and setbacks that change the nature of the adventuring situation. In exchange for success, players must consider new ways of facing the <span class=\"No-Break\">challenge.</span></p><p>You can also use this technique when a character succeeds on a roll by hitting the DC exactly, complicating marginal success in interes<span class=\"No-Break\">ting ways.</span></p><h4>Degrees of Failure</h4><p>Sometimes a failed ability check has different consequences depending on the degree of failure. For example, a character who fails to disarm a trapped chest might accidentally spring the trap if the check fails by 5 or more, whereas a lesser failure means that the trap wasn’t triggered during the botched disarm attempt. Consider adding similar distinctions to other checks. Perhaps a failed Charisma (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Persuasion\">Persuasion</a>) check means a queen won’t help, whereas a failure of 5 or more means she throws you in the dungeon for your <span class=\"No-Break\">impudence.</span></p><h4>Critical Success or Failure</h4><p>Rolling a 20 or a 1 on an ability check or a saving throw doesn’t normally have any special effect. However, you can choose to take such an exceptional roll into account when adjudicating the outcome. It’s up to you to determine how this manifests in the game. An easy approach is to increase the impact of the success or failure. For example, rolling a 1 on a failed attempt to pick a lock might break the thieves’ tools being used, and rolling a 20 on a successful Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\">Investigation</a>) check might reveal an e<span class=\"No-Break\">xtra clue.</span></p><h2>Exploration</h2><p>This section provides guidance for running exploration, especially travel, tracking, and v<span class=\"No-Break\">isibility.</span></p><h3>Using a Map</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/878/c8-04.png\"></p><p>Whatever environment the adventurers are exploring, you can use a map to follow their progress as you relate the details of their travels. In a dungeon, tracking movement on a map lets you describe the branching passages, doors, chambers, and other features the adventurers encounter as they go, and gives the players the opportunity to choose their own path. Similarly, a wilderness map can show roads, rivers, terrain, and other features that might guide the characters on their travels — or lead th<span class=\"No-Break\">em astray.</span></p><p>The Map Travel Pace table helps you track travel on maps of different scales. The table shows how much distance on a map the adventurers can cover on foot in minutes, hours, or days. The table uses the travel paces — slow, normal, and fast — described in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em>. Characters moving at a normal pace can walk about 24 miles<span class=\"No-Break\"> in a day.</span></p><h5>Map Travel Pace</h5><div><table class=\"rtg-medium-header-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Map Scale</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Slow Pace</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Normal Pace</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Fast Pace</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Dungeon<br>(1 sq. = 10 ft.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">20 sq./min.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">30 sq./min.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">40 sq./min.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">City<br>(1 sq. = 100 ft.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2 sq./min.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">3 sq./min.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4 sq./min.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Province<br>(1 hex = 1 mi.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2 hexes/hr., 18 hexes/day</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">3 hexes/hr., 24 hexes/day</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4 hexes/hr., 30 hexes/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Kingdom<br>(1 hex = 6 mi.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 hex/3 hr., 3 hexes/day</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 hex/2 hr., 4 hexes/day</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 hex/1½ hr., 5 hexes/day</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h3>Special Travel Pace</h3><p>The rules on travel pace in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em> assume that a group of travelers adopts a pace that, over time, is unaffected by the individual members’ walking speeds. The difference between walking speeds can be significant during combat, but during an overland journey, the difference vanishes as travelers pause to catch their breath, the faster ones wait for the slower ones, and one traveler’s quickness is matched by another traveler’s <span class=\"No-Break\">endurance.</span></p><p>A character bestride a phantom steed, soaring through the air on a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/carpet-of-flying\" data-type=\"magic-item\" data-name=\"carpet of flying\">carpet of flying</a></span>, or riding a sailboat or a steam-powered gnomish contraption doesn’t travel at a normal rate, since the magic, engine, or wind doesn’t tire the way a creature does and the air doesn’t contain the types of obstructions found on land. When a creature is traveling with a flying speed or with a speed granted by magic, an engine, or a natural force (such as wind or a water current), translate that speed into travel rates using the follow<span class=\"No-Break\">ing rules:</span></p><ul>\n<li>In 1 minute, you can move a number of feet equal to your speed<span class=\"No-Break\"> times 10.</span></li>\n<li>In 1 hour, you can move a number of miles equal to your speed divi<span class=\"No-Break\">ded by 10.</span></li>\n<li>For daily travel, multiply your hourly rate of travel by the number of hours traveled (typically<span class=\"No-Break\"> 8 hours).</span></li>\n<li>For a fast pace, increase the rate of travel by <span class=\"No-Break\">one-third.</span></li>\n<li>For a slow pace, multiply the rate by t<span class=\"No-Break\">wo-thirds.</span></li>\n</ul><p>For example, a character under the effect of a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wind-walk\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"wind walk\">wind walk</a></span> spell gains a flying speed of 300 feet. In 1 minute, the character can move 3,000 feet at a normal pace, 4,000 feet at a fast pace, or 2,000 feet at a slow pace. The character can also cover 20, 30, or 40 miles in an hour. The spell lasts for 8 hours, allowing the character to travel 160, 240, or 320 miles<span class=\"No-Break\"> in a day.</span></p><p>Similarly, a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/phantom-steed\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"phantom steed\">phantom steed</a></span> spell creates a magical mount with a speed of 100 feet that doesn’t tire like a real horse. A character on a phantom steed can cover 1,000 feet in 1 minute at a normal pace, 1,333 feet at a fast pace, or 666 feet at a slow pace. In 1 hour, the character can travel 7, 10, or<span class=\"No-Break\"> 13 miles.</span></p><h3>Visibility Outdoors</h3><p>When traveling outdoors, characters can see about 2 miles in any direction on a clear day, or until the point where trees, hills, or other obstructions block their view. Rain normally cuts maximum visibility down to 1 mile, and fog can cut it down to between 100 and<span class=\"No-Break\"> 300 feet.</span></p><p>On a clear day, the characters can see 40 miles if they are atop a mountain or a tall hill, or are otherwise able to look down on the area around them from<span class=\"No-Break\"> a height.</span></p><h3>Noticing Other Creatures</h3><p>While exploring, characters might encounter other creatures. An important question in such a situation is who not<span class=\"No-Break\">ices whom.</span></p><p>Indoors, whether the sides can see one another usually depends on the configuration of rooms and passageways. Vision might also be limited by light sources. Outdoor visibility can be hampered by terrain, weather, and time of day. Creatures can be more likely to hear one another before they see<span class=\"No-Break\"> anything.</span></p><p>If neither side is being stealthy, creatures automatically notice each other once they are within sight or hearing range of one another. Otherwise, compare the Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth\">Stealth</a>) check results of the creatures in the group that is hiding with the passive Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) scores of the other group, as explained in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s</span><span class=\"No-Break\"><span class=\"italic\"> Handbook</span></span></em><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><h3>Tracking</h3><p>Adventurers sometimes choose their path by following the tracks of other creatures — or other creatures might track the adventurers! To track, one or more creatures must succeed on a Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival\">Survival</a>) check. You might require trackers to make a new check in any of the following circ<span class=\"No-Break\">umstances:</span></p><ul>\n<li>They stop tracking and resume after finishing a short or <span class=\"No-Break\">long rest.</span></li>\n<li>The trail crosses an obstacle, such as a river, that shows <span class=\"No-Break\">no tracks.</span></li>\n<li>The weather conditions or terrain changes in a way that makes tracki<span class=\"No-Break\">ng harder.</span></li>\n</ul><p>The DC for the check depends on how well the ground shows signs of a creature’s passage. No roll is necessary in situations where the tracks are obvious. For example, no check is needed to track an army advancing along a muddy road. Spotting tracks on a bare stone floor is more challenging, unless the creature being tracked leaves a distinct trail. Additionally, the passage of time often makes tracks harder to follow. In a situation where there is no trail to follow, you can rule that tracking is i<span class=\"No-Break\">mpossible.</span></p><p>The Tracking DCs table offers guidelines for setting the DC or, if you prefer, you can choose a DC based on your assessment of the difficulty. You can also grant advantage on the check if there’s more than one set of tracks to follow, or disadvantage if the trail being followed passes through a well-traffi<span class=\"No-Break\">cked area.</span></p><p>On a failed check, the character loses the trail but can attempt to find it again by making a careful search of the area. It takes 10 minutes to find a trail in a confined area such as a dungeon, or 1 hour<span class=\"No-Break\"> outdoors.</span></p><h5>Tracking DCs</h5><div><table class=\"rtg-long-header-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Ground Surface</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">DC</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Soft surface such as snow</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Dirt or grass</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Bare stone</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Each day since the creature passed</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Creature left a trail such as blood</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">−5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h2>Social Interaction</h2><p>During a social interaction, the adventurers usually have a goal. They want to extract information, secure aid, win someone’s trust, escape punishment, avoid combat, negotiate a treaty, or achieve whatever other objective led to the interaction in the first place. The creatures they interact with also hav<span class=\"No-Break\">e agendas.</span></p><p>Some DMs prefer to run a social interaction as a free-form roleplaying exercise, where dice rarely come into play. Other DMs prefer to resolve the outcome of an interaction by having characters make Charisma checks. Either approach works, and most games fall somewhere in between, balancing player skill (roleplaying and persuading) with character skill (reflected by abilit<span class=\"No-Break\">y checks).</span></p><h3>Resolving Interactions</h3><p>The <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em> provides guidelines for balancing roleplaying and ability checks in a social interaction (see chapter 8, \"<a title=\"Adventuring\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring#SocialInteraction\">Adventuring</a>\"). This section adds to that material by providing a structured way to resolve a social interaction. Much of this structure will be invisible to your players in play and isn’t meant to be a substitute for ro<span class=\"No-Break\">leplaying.</span></p><h4>1. Starting Attitude</h4><p>Choose the starting attitude of a creature the adventurers are interacting with: friendly, indifferent, o<span class=\"No-Break\">r hostile.</span></p><p>A <strong><span class=\"bold\">friendly</span></strong> creature wants to help the adventurers and wishes for them to succeed. For tasks or actions that require no particular risk, effort, or cost, friendly creatures usually help without question. If an element of personal risk is involved, a successful Charisma check might be required to convince a friendly creature to take <span class=\"No-Break\">that risk.</span></p><p>An <strong><span class=\"bold\">indifferent</span></strong> creature might help or hinder the party, depending on what the creature sees as most beneficial. A creature’s indifference doesn’t necessarily make it standoffish or disinterested. Indifferent creatures might be polite and genial, surly and irritable, or anything in between. A successful Charisma check is necessary when the adventurers try to persuade an indifferent creature to do <span class=\"No-Break\">something.</span></p><p>A <strong><span class=\"bold\">hostile</span></strong> creature opposes the adventurers and their goals but doesn’t necessarily attack them on sight. For example, a condescending noble might wish to see a group of upstart adventurers fail so as to keep them from becoming rivals for the king’s attention, thwarting them with slander and scheming rather than direct threats and violence. The adventurers need to succeed on one or more challenging Charisma checks to convince a hostile creature to do anything on their behalf. That said, a hostile creature might be so ill-disposed toward the party that no Charisma check can improve its attitude, in which case any attempt to sway it through diplomacy fails auto<span class=\"No-Break\">matically.</span></p><h4>2. Conversation</h4><p><strong>Play out the conversation.</strong> Let the adventurers make their points, trying to frame their statements in terms that are meaningful to the creature they are interac<span class=\"No-Break\">ting with.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Changing Attitude.</span></strong> The attitude of a creature might change over the course of a conversation. If the adventurers say or do the right things during an interaction (perhaps by touching on a creature’s ideal, bond, or flaw), they can make a hostile creature temporarily indifferent, or make an indifferent creature temporarily friendly. Likewise, a gaffe, insult, or harmful deed might make a friendly creature temporarily indifferent or turn an indifferent creatur<span class=\"No-Break\">e hostile.</span></p><p>Whether the adventurers can shift a creature’s attitude is up to you. You decide whether the adventurers have successfully couched their statements in terms that matter to the creature. Typically, a creature’s attitude can’t shift more than one step during a single interaction, whether temporarily or pe<span class=\"No-Break\">rmanently.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Determining Characteristics.</span></strong> The adventurers don’t necessarily enter into a social interaction with a full understanding of a creature’s ideal, bond, or flaw. If they want to shift a creature’s attitude by playing on these characteristics, they first need to determine what the creature cares about. They can guess, but doing so runs the risk of shifting the creature’s attitude in the wrong direction if they gu<span class=\"No-Break\">ess badly.</span></p><p>After interacting with a creature long enough to get a sense of its personality traits and characteristics through conversation, an adventurer can attempt a Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Insight\">Insight</a>) check to uncover one of the creature’s characteristics. You set the DC. A check that fails by 10 or more might misidentify a characteristic, so you should provide a false characteristic or invert one of the creature’s existing characteristics. For example, if an old sage’s flaw is that he is prejudiced against the uneducated, an adventurer who badly fails the check might be told that the sage enjoys personally seeing to the education of the do<span class=\"No-Break\">wntrodden.</span></p><p>Given time, adventurers can also learn about a creature’s characteristics from other sources, including its friends and allies, personal letters, and publicly told stories. Acquiring such information might be the basis of an entirely different set of social int<span class=\"No-Break\">eractions.</span></p><h4>3. Charisma Check</h4><p>When the adventurers get to the point of their request, demand, or suggestion — or if you decide the conversation has run its course — call for a Charisma check. Any character who has actively participated in the conversation can make the check. Depending on how the adventurers handled the conversation, the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Persuasion\">Persuasion</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Deception\">Deception</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Intimidation\">Intimidation</a> skill might apply to the check. The creature’s current attitude determines the DC required to achieve a specific reaction, as shown in the Conversation React<span class=\"No-Break\">ion table.</span></p><h5>Conversation Reaction</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1590072759\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[NGxREGkHzgLpVX12]{Friendly Creatures Reaction}</span></div></div></div><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1590072760\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[h9tL6sUw3TfgaguU]{Indifferent Creatures Reaction}</span></div></div></div><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1590072761\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[HTItOonUW2UyfemE]{Hostile Creatures Reaction}</span></div></div></div><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Aiding the Check. </span></strong>Other characters who make substantial contributions to the conversation can help the character making the check. If a helping character says or does something that would influence the interaction in a positive way, the character making the Charisma check can do so with advantage. If the other character inadvertently says something counterproductive or offensive, the character making the Charisma check has disadvantage on t<span class=\"No-Break\">hat check.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Multiple Checks.</span></strong> Certain situations might call for more than one check, particularly if the adventurers come into the interaction with multi<span class=\"No-Break\">ple goals.</span></p><h4>4. Repeat?</h4><p>Once a Charisma check has been made, further attempts to influence the target of the interaction might be fruitless or run the risk of upsetting or angering the subject creature, potentially shifting its attitude toward hostility. Use your best judgment. For example, if the party’s rogue says something that pushes a noble’s attitude toward the party from indifferent to hostile, another character might be able to diffuse the noble’s hostility with clever roleplaying and a successful Charisma (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Persuasion\">Persuasion</a>) check.</p><h3>Roleplaying</h3><p>For some DMs, roleplaying comes naturally. If it doesn’t come naturally for you, don’t worry. The main thing is for you to have fun portraying your NPCs and monsters and to amuse your players in the process. You don’t need to be a practiced thespian or comedian to create drama or humor. The key is to pay attention to the story elements and characterizations that make your players laugh or feel emotionally engaged and to incorporate those things into your ro<span class=\"No-Break\">leplaying.</span></p><h4>Being the NPC</h4><p>Imagine how a character or monster you bring to life would react to the adventurers. Consider what it cares about. Does it have any ideals, flaws, or bonds? By working such things into your portrayal, you not only make the character or monster more believable, but you also enhance the sense that the adventurers are in a liv<span class=\"No-Break\">ing world.</span></p><p>Strive for responses and actions that introduce twists into the game. For example, an old woman whose family was killed at the hands of an evil wizard might regard the party’s wizard with grave <span class=\"No-Break\">suspicion.</span></p><p>However you roleplay a character or monster, the classic advice for writers holds true: show, don’t tell. For example, rather than describe an NPC as shallow and self-centered, have the individual act the way you would expect a shallow, self-centered person to behave. The NPC might have off-the-cuff answers for everything, an over-willingness to share personal anecdotes, and a desperate need to make himself or herself the subject of every con<span class=\"No-Break\">versation.</span></p><h4>Using Your Voice</h4><p>Most of what you say during a session will be at a consistent level. For dramatic effect, be ready to shout out a battle cry or speak in a conspiratoria<span class=\"No-Break\">l whisper.</span></p><p>Also, characters and monsters with distinctive voices are memorable. If you’re not a natural mimic or actor, borrowing distinctive speech patterns from real life, the movies, or television is a good place to start. Practice different voices and impersonations of famous people, then use those voices to bring your NPC<span class=\"No-Break\">s to life.</span></p><p>Experiment with different speech patterns. For instance, a barmaid and a city magistrate probably use their words differently. Similarly, peasants could speak in earthy dialects, while rich folk talk in haughty drawls. Let a pirate NPC say, “Arrrr, maties!” in your best Long John Silver voice. Let intelligent monsters unfamiliar with Common stumble along with awkward grammar. Let drunkards and monsters mutter with slurred speech, while lizardfolk hiss thei<span class=\"No-Break\">r threats.</span></p><p>In any interaction with multiple NPCs, make sure the adventurers remain the focus. Have the NPCs talk to them, not so much to each other. If possible, let one NPC do most of the talking, but if multiple NPCs need to talk, give them distinct voices so the players know <span class=\"No-Break\">who’s who.</span></p><h4>Using Your Face and Arms</h4><p>Use your facial expressions to help show a character’s emotions. Scowl, smile, grin, snarl, pout, cross your eyes — do whatever it takes to make the character or monster memorable to the players. When you combine facial expressions with an unusual voice, a character truly come<span class=\"No-Break\">s to life.</span></p><p>Though you don’t need to stand up out of your chair, you can use your arms to bring even more life to an NPC. A noble could chop the air with one hand while speaking in a deadpan monotone, while an archmage might express her displeasure by silently rolling her eyes and massaging her temples with he<span class=\"No-Break\">r fingers.</span></p><h4>Engaging the Players</h4><p>Some players enjoy roleplaying and interaction more than others. Whatever your players’ tastes, your lively portrayal of NPCs and monsters can inspire players to make just as much investment in portraying their characters. This makes social interactions an opportunity for everyone to become more immersed in the game, creating a story whose protagonists h<span class=\"No-Break\">ave depth.</span></p><p>To make sure everyone has something to do during a roleplaying-heavy game session, consider one or more of the following a<span class=\"No-Break\">pproaches.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Appeal to Player Preferences.</span></strong> There are in-game activities that players enjoy more than others, as discussed in the <a title=\"Introduction\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/introduction\">Introduction</a>. Players who like acting thrive in interaction situations, and it’s fine to let those players take the spotlight. They often inspire other players by their example, but make sure those other players have an opportunity to join i<span class=\"No-Break\">n the fun.</span></p><p>Players who like exploring and storytelling are usually amenable to roleplaying, as long as it moves the campaign forward and reveals more about the world. Players who like problem-solving often enjoy figuring out the right thing to say to shift an NPC’s attitude. Players who are instigators like provoking reactions from NPCs, so they’re often easily engaged — though not always pro<span class=\"No-Break\">ductively.</span></p><p>Players who like to optimize their characters and slay monsters also like to argue, and having conflict within an interaction can help those players embrace roleplaying. Still, creating combat connections to an extended interaction (such as a corrupt vizier sending assassins to kill the adventurers) is often the best way to keep action-focused player<span class=\"No-Break\">s engaged.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Target Specific Characters.</span></strong> Create situations where characters who might not otherwise be engaged with a social interaction have to do at least some of the talking. Perhaps the NPC in question is a family member or a contact of a particular adventurer and talks only to that character. An NPC of a certain race or class might listen only to characters he or she feels a kinship with. Creating a sense of importance can be a great way to get specific players engaged, but don’t shut out players who are already ro<span class=\"No-Break\">leplaying.</span></p><p>If a couple of players are dominating the conversation, take a moment now and then to involve the others. You can do this in character if you like: “And what about your hulking friend? Speak, barbarian! What will you pledge in exchange for my favor?” Or just ask the player what his or her character is doing while the conversation is going on. The first approach is better for players who are already comfortable speaking in their characters’ voices. The second approach works better for players who need encouragement to engage in a roleplaying<span class=\"No-Break\"> scenario.</span></p><h2>Objects</h2><p>When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash a vampire’s coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible object. Use common sense when determining a character’s success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the <span class=\"No-Break\">wall does.</span></p><p>For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many othe<span class=\"No-Break\">r objects.</span></p><h4>Statistics for Objects</h4><p>When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types <span class=\"No-Break\">of damage.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Armor Class.</span></strong> An object’s Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various s<span class=\"No-Break\">ubstances.</span></p><h5>Object Armor Class</h5><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Substance</th>\n<th>AC</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Substance</th>\n<th>AC</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Cloth, paper, rope</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Iron, steel</td>\n<td>19</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Crystal, glass, ice</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Mithral</td>\n<td>21</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wood, bone</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Adamantine</td>\n<td>23</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Stone</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Hit Points.</span></strong> An object’s hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large o<span class=\"No-Break\">r smaller.</span></p><h5>Object Hit Points</h5><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Size</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Fragile</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Resilient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Tiny (bottle, lock)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2 (1d4)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">5 (2d4)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Small (chest, lute)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">3 (1d6)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">10 (3d6)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Medium (barrel, chandelier)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4 (1d8)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">18 (4d8)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Large (cart, 10-ft.-by-10-ft. window)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">5 (1d10)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">27 (5d10)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Huge and Gargantuan Objects. </span></strong>Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/earthquake\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"earthquake\">earthquake</a></span> spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object’s hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section’s hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 h<span class=\"No-Break\">it points.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Objects and Damage Types.</span></strong> Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can’t effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best<span class=\"No-Break\"> judgment.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Damage Threshold. </span></strong>Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object’s damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn’t reduce the object’s h<span class=\"No-Break\">it points.</span></p><h2>Combat</h2><p>This section builds on the combat rules in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em> and offers tips for keeping the game running smoothly when a fight b<span class=\"No-Break\">reaks out.</span></p><h3>Tracking Initiative</h3><p>You can use several different methods for keeping track of who goes when <span class=\"No-Break\">in combat.</span></p><h4>Hidden List</h4><p>Many DMs keep track of initiative on a list the players can’t see: usually a piece of paper behind a DM screen or a spreadsheet on a tablet computer. This method allows you to keep track of combatants who haven’t been revealed yet, and you can use the initiative list as a place to record the current hit points of monsters, as well as other use<span class=\"No-Break\">ful notes.</span></p><p>A downside of this approach is that you have to remind the players round after round when their turn<span class=\"No-Break\">s come up.</span></p><h4>Visible List</h4><p>You can use a whiteboard to track initiative. As the players tell you their initiative numbers, write them on the whiteboard in order from highest to lowest, leaving space between each name. Either write the monsters’ initiatives on the list at the same time or add them to the list on each monster’s f<span class=\"No-Break\">irst turn.</span></p><p>As a further improvement, use magnets that you can attach to a metal-based whiteboard with characters’ and monsters’ names written on them, or write those names on cards held in place b<span class=\"No-Break\">y magnets.</span></p><p>A visible list lets everyone see the order of play. Players know when their turns are coming up, and they can start planning their actions in advance. A visible list also removes any uncertainty about when the monsters will act in <span class=\"No-Break\">the fight.</span></p><p>A variation on the visible list is to give one player responsibility for keeping track of initiative, either on a whiteboard or on a piece of paper the other players can see. This method reduces the number of things you need to keep track of<span class=\"No-Break\"> yourself.</span></p><h4>Index Cards</h4><p>In this approach, each character gets an index card, as does each group of identical monsters. When the players tell you their initiative numbers, write the numbers on their characters’ index cards. Do the same when you roll the monsters’ initiative. Then arrange the cards in order from highest to lowest. Starting at the top, you move down through the stack. When you call out the name of the character whose turn it is, also mention who’s next, prompting that player to start thinking ahead. After each character or group of monsters acts, the top card is moved to the bottom of <span class=\"No-Break\">the stack.</span></p><p>At first, players don’t know the order of play when you use combat cards, and they don’t know where the monsters fall into the order until the mon<span class=\"No-Break\">sters act.</span></p><h3>Tracking Monster Hit Points</h3><p>During a combat encounter, you need to track how much damage each monster takes. Most DMs track damage in secret so that their players don’t know how many hit points a monster has remaining. Whether you choose to be secretive or not is up to you. What’s important is that every monster’s hit points be tracked ind<span class=\"No-Break\">ividually.</span></p><p>Tracking damage for one or two monsters isn’t onerous, but it helps to have a system for larger groups of monsters. If you aren’t using miniatures or other visual aids, the easiest way to keep track of your monsters is to assign them unique features. Descriptions such as “the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ogre\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"ogre\">ogre</a> with the nasty scar” and “the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ogre\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"ogre\">ogre</a> with the horned helm” help you and your players track which monster is which. For example, imagine that you’re running an encounter with three ogres, each of which has 59 hit points. Once initiative is rolled, jot down each ogre’s hit points and add notes (and even a name, if you like) to differentiate<span class=\"No-Break\"> each one:</span></p><p>Krag (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ogre\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"ogre\">ogre</a> w/<span class=\"No-Break\"> scar): 59</span></p><p>Thod (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ogre\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"ogre\">ogre</a> w/<span class=\"No-Break\"> helm): 59</span></p><p>Mur (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ogre\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"ogre\">ogre</a> who smells lik<span class=\"No-Break\">e poo): 59</span></p><p>If you use miniatures to represent monsters, one easy way to differentiate them is to give each one a unique miniature. If you use identical miniatures to represent multiple monsters, you can tag the miniatures with small stickers of different colors or stickers with different letters or number<span class=\"No-Break\">s on them.</span></p><p>For example, in a combat encounter with three ogres, you could use three identical ogre miniatures tagged with stickers marked A, B, and C, respectively. To track the ogres’ hit points, you can sort them by letter, then subtract damage from their hit points as they take it. Your records might look something like this after a few rounds <span class=\"No-Break\">of combat:</span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ogre\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"Ogre\">Ogre</a> A: <del><span class=\"CharOverride-5\">59</span> <span class=\"CharOverride-5\">53</span> <span class=\"CharOverride-5\">45</span> <span class=\"CharOverride-5\">24</span> <span class=\"No-Break CharOverride-5\">14</span> <span class=\"No-Break CharOverride-5\">9</span></del><span class=\"No-Break\"> dead</span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ogre\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"Ogre\">Ogre</a> B<span class=\"No-Break\">: </span><del><span class=\"No-Break CharOverride-5\">59</span> <span class=\"No-Break CharOverride-5\">51</span></del><span class=\"No-Break\"> 30</span></p><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ogre\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"Ogre\">Ogre</a> C: 59</span></p><p>Players often ask how hurt a monster looks. Don’t ever feel as though you need to reveal exact hit points, but if a monster is below half its hit point maximum, it’s fair to say that it has visible wounds and appears beaten down. You can describe a monster taken to half its hit points as bloodied, giving the players a sense of progress in a fight against a tough opponent, and helping them judge when to use their most powerful spells and <span class=\"No-Break\">abilities.</span></p><h3>Using and Tracking Conditions</h3><p>Various rules and features in the game are clear about when they apply a condition to a creature. You can also apply conditions on the fly. They’re meant to be intuitive for you to do so. For example, if a character is in a state, such as sleep, that lacks consciousness, you can say the character is <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\">unconscious</a>. Or did a character just stumble onto the ground? He or she is <span class=\"No-Break\">now <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\">prone</a>.</span></p><p>Keeping track of conditions can become tricky. For monsters, it’s often easiest to track conditions on combat cards or wherever you track initiative. Players should remember any conditions affecting their characters. Because players have incentive to forget or overlook hampering conditions, character conditions can also be marked on combat cards or a w<span class=\"No-Break\">hiteboard.</span></p><p>You might also try keeping a supply of index cards on hand, marked with conditions and their effects. Then hand the cards to players as the conditions come up. Having a bright pink index card on top of a character sheet can help even the most absentminded player remember the effects of being <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\">charmed</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a>.</p><h3>Monsters and Critical Hits</h3><p>A monster follows the same rule for critical hits as a player character. That said, if you use a monster’s average damage, rather than rolling, you might wonder how to handle a critical hit. When the monster scores a critical hit, roll all the damage dice associated with the hit and add them to the average damage. For example, if a goblin normally deals 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage on a hit and scores a critical hit, it deals 5 + 1d6 slashi<span class=\"No-Break\">ng damage.</span></p><h3>Improvising Damage</h3><p>A monster or effect typically specifies the amount of damage it deals. In some cases, though, you need to determine damage on the fly. The Improvising Damage table gives you suggestions for when <span class=\"No-Break\">you do so.</span></p><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1151567301\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[rYWRRvgefaRnYSq4]{Examples}</span></div></div></div><p>The Damage Severity and Level table is a guide to how deadly these damage numbers are for characters of various levels.

This level of damage can kill even powerful characters outright if they are alread<span class=\"No-Break\">y wounded.</span></p><h3>Adjudicating Areas of Effect</h3><p>Many spells and other game features create areas of effect, such as the cone and the sphere. If you’re not using miniatures or another visual aid, it can sometimes be difficult to determine who’s in an area of effect and who isn’t. The easiest way to address such uncertainty is to go with your gut and ma<span class=\"No-Break\">ke a call.</span></p><p>If you would like more guidance, consider using the Targets in Areas of Effect table. To use the table, imagine which combatants are near one another, and let the table guide you in determining the number of those combatants that are caught in an area of effect. Add or subtract targets based on how bunched up the potential targets are. Consider rolling 1d3 to determine the amount to add or<span class=\"No-Break\"> subtract.</span></p><h5>Targets in Areas of Effect</h5><div><table class=\"rtg-medium-header-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Area</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Number of Targets</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Cone</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Size ÷ 10 (round up)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Cube or square</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Size ÷ 5 (round up)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Cylinder</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Radius ÷ 5 (round up)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Line</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Length ÷ 30 (round up)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Sphere or circle</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Radius ÷ 5 (round up)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p>For example, if a wizard directs <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/burning-hands\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"burning hands\">burning hands</a></span> (a 15-foot cone) at a nearby group of orcs, you could use the table and say that two orcs are targeted (15 ÷ 10 = 1.5, rounded up to 2). Similarly, a sorcerer could launch a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lightning-bolt\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"lightning bolt\">lightning bolt</a></span> (100-foot line) at some ogres and hobgoblins, and you could use the table to say four of the monsters are targeted (100 ÷ 30 = 3.33, rounded<span class=\"No-Break\"> up to 4).</span></p><p>This approach aims at simplicity instead of spatial precision. If you prefer more tactical nuance, consider using m<span class=\"No-Break\">iniatures.</span></p><h3>Handling Mobs</h3><p>Keeping combat moving along at a brisk pace can be difficult when there are dozens of monsters involved in a battle. When handling a crowded battlefield, you can speed up play by forgoing attack rolls in favor of approximating the average number of hits a large group of monsters can inflict on<span class=\"No-Break\"> a target.</span></p><p>Instead of rolling an attack roll, determine the minimum d20 roll a creature needs in order to hit a target by subtracting its attack bonus from the target’s AC. You’ll need to refer to the result throughout the battle, so it’s best to writ<span class=\"No-Break\">e it down.</span></p><p>Look up the minimum d20 roll needed on the Mob Attacks table. The table shows you how many creatures that need that die roll or higher must attack a target in order for one of them to hit. If that many creatures attack the target, their combined efforts result in one of them hitting t<span class=\"No-Break\">he target.</span></p><p>For example, eight <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/orc\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"orc\">orc</a><span class=\"plural-monster-tooltip\"><strong>s</strong></span> surround a fighter. The <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/orc\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"orc\">orc</a><strong><span class=\"plural-monster-tooltip\">s</span></strong>’ attack bonus is +5, and the fighter’s AC is 19. The <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/orc\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"orc\">orc</a><strong><span class=\"plural-monster-tooltip\">s</span></strong> need a 14 or higher to hit the fighter. According to the table, for every three <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/orc\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"orc\">orc</a><span class=\"plural-monster-tooltip\"><strong>s</strong></span> that attack the fighter, one of them hits. There are enough <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/orc\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"orc\">orc</a><strong><span class=\"plural-monster-tooltip\">s</span></strong> for two groups of three. The remaining two <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/orc\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"orc\">orc</a><span class=\"plural-monster-tooltip\"><strong>s</strong></span>&nbsp;fail to hit th<span class=\"No-Break\">e fighter.</span></p><p>If the attacking creatures deal different amounts of damage, assume that the creature that deals the most damage is the one that hits. If the creature that hits has multiple attacks with the same attack bonus, assume that it hits once with each of those attacks. If a creature’s attacks have different attack bonuses, resolve each attack s<span class=\"No-Break\">eparately.</span></p><p>This attack resolution system ignores critical hits in favor of reducing the number of die rolls. As the number of combatants dwindles, switch back to using individual die rolls to avoid situations where one side can’t possibly hit <span class=\"No-Break\">the other.</span></p><h4>Mob Attacks</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1526436968\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[7WmitiWjstAE0vq7]{Attackers Needed for One to Hit}</span></div></div></div><h3>Using Miniatures</h3><p>In combat, players can often rely on your descriptions to visualize where their characters are in relation to their surroundings and their enemies. Some complex battles, however, are easier to run with visual aids, the most common of which are miniatures and a grid. If you like to construct model terrain, build three-dimensional dungeons, or draw maps on large vinyl mats, you should also consider using m<span class=\"No-Break\">iniatures.</span></p><p>The <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em> offers simple rules for depicting combat using miniature figures on a grid. This section expands on that<span class=\"No-Break\"> material.</span></p><h4>Tactical Maps</h4><p>You can draw tactical maps with colored markers on a wet-erase vinyl mat with 1-inch squares, on a large sheet of paper, or on a similar flat surface. Preprinted poster-sized maps, maps assembled from cardboard tiles, and terrain made of sculpted plaster or resin are<span class=\"No-Break\"> also fun.</span></p><p>The most common unit for tactical maps is the 5-foot square, and maps with grids are readily available and easy to create. However, you don’t have to use a grid at all. You can track distances with a tape measure, string, craft sticks, or pipe cleaners cut to specific lengths. Another option is a play surface covered by 1-inch hexagons (often called hexes), which combines the easy counting of a grid with the more flexible movement of using no grid. Dungeon corridors with straight walls and right angles don’t map easily onto hexe<span class=\"No-Break\">s, though.</span></p><h4>Creature Size on Squares and Hexes</h4><p>A creature’s size determines how much space it occupies on squares or hexes, as shown in the Creature Size and Space table. If the miniature you use for a monster takes up an amount of space different from what’s on the table, that’s fine, but treat the monster as its official size for all other rules. For example, you might use a miniature that has a Large base to represent a Huge giant. That giant takes up less space on the battlefield than its size suggests, but it is still Huge for the purposes of rules like <span class=\"No-Break\">grappling.</span></p><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/901/c8-05.png\"></span></p><h5>Creature Size and Space</h5><div><table class=\"rtg-medium-header-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Size</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Space: Squares</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Space: Hexes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Tiny</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4 per square</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4 per hex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Small</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 square</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 hex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Medium</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 square</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 hex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Large</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4 squares (2 by 2)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">3 hexes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Huge</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">9 squares (3 by 3)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">7 hexes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Gargantuan</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">16 squares (4 by 4) or more</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">12 hexes or more</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/902/c8-06.png\"></p><h4>Areas of Effect</h4><p>The area of effect of a spell, monster ability, or other feature must be translated onto squares or hexes to determine which potential targets are in the area and whi<span class=\"No-Break\">ch aren’t.</span></p><p>Choose an intersection of squares or hexes as the point of origin of an area of effect, then follow its rules as normal. If an area of effect is circular and covers at least half a square, it affects th<span class=\"No-Break\">at square.</span></p><h4>Line of Sight</h4><p>To precisely determine whether there is line of sight between two spaces, pick a corner of one space and trace an imaginary line from that corner to any part of another space. If at least one such line doesn’t pass through or touch an object or effect that blocks vision — such as a stone wall, a thick curtain, or a dense cloud of fog — then there is line<span class=\"No-Break\"> of sight.</span></p><h4>Cover</h4><p>To determine whether a target has cover against an attack or other effect on a grid, choose a corner of the attacker’s space or the point of origin of an area of effect. Then trace imaginary lines from that corner to every corner of any one square the target occupies. If one or two of those lines are blocked by an obstacle (including another creature), the target has half cover. If three or four of those lines are blocked but the attack can still reach the target (such as when the target is behind an arrow slit), the target has three-quart<span class=\"No-Break\">ers cover.</span></p><p>On hexes, use the same procedure as a grid, drawing lines between the corners of the hexagons. The target has half cover if up to three lines are blocked by an obstacle, and three-quarters cover if four or more lines are blocked but the attack can still reach t<span class=\"No-Break\">he target.</span></p><h4>Optional Rule: Flanking</h4><p>If you regularly use miniatures, flanking gives combatants a simple way to gain advantage on attack rolls against a com<span class=\"No-Break\">mon enemy.</span></p><p>A creature can’t flank an enemy that it can’t see. A creature also can’t flank while it is <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a>. A Large or larger creature is flanking as long as at least one square or hex of its space qualifies for<span class=\"No-Break\"> flanking.</span></p><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/5/374/squares_dmg.png\"></span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Flanking on Squares.</span></strong> When a creature and at least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite sides or corners of the enemy’s space, they flank that enemy, and each of them has advantage on melee attack rolls against t<span class=\"No-Break\">hat enemy.</span></p><p>When in doubt about whether two creatures flank an enemy on a grid, trace an imaginary line between the centers of the creatures’ spaces. If the line passes through opposite sides or corners of the enemy’s space, the enemy i<span class=\"No-Break\">s flanked.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Flanking on Hexes. </span></strong>When a creature and at least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite sides of the enemy’s space, they flank that enemy, and each of them has advantage on attack rolls against that enemy. On hexes, count around the enemy from one creature to its ally. Against a Medium or smaller creature, the allies flank if there are 2 hexes between them. Against a Large creature, the allies flank if there are 4 hexes between them. Against a Huge creature, they must have 5 hexes between them. Against a Gargantuan creature, they must have at least 6 hexes bet<span class=\"No-Break\">ween them.</span></p><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/5/375/hex_dmg.png\"></span></p><h4>Optional Rule: Diagonals</h4><p>The <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em> presents a simple method for counting movement and measuring range on a grid: count every square as 5 feet, even if you’re moving diagonally. Though this is fast in play, it breaks the laws of geometry and is inaccurate over long distances. This optional rule provides more realism, but it requires more effort duri<span class=\"No-Break\">ng combat.</span></p><p>When measuring range or moving diagonally on a grid, the first diagonal square counts as 5 feet, but the second diagonal square counts as 10 feet. This pattern of 5 feet and then 10 feet continues whenever you’re counting diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between different bits of diagonal movement. For example, a character might move one square diagonally (5 feet), then three squares straight (15 feet), and then another square diagonally (10 feet) for a total movement o<span class=\"No-Break\">f 30 feet.</span></p><h4>Optional Rule: Facing</h4><p>If you want the precision of knowing which way a creature is facing, consider using this opti<span class=\"No-Break\">onal rule.</span></p><p>Whenever a creature ends its move, it can change its facing. Each creature has a front arc (the direction it faces), left and right side arcs, and a rear arc. A creature can also change its facing as a reaction when any other creat<span class=\"No-Break\">ure moves.</span></p><p>A creature can normally target only creatures in its front or side arcs. It can’t see into its rear arc. This means an attacker in the creature’s rear arc makes attack rolls against it with <span class=\"No-Break\">advantage.</span></p><p>Shields apply their bonus to AC only against attacks from the front arc or the same side arc as the shield. For example, a fighter with a shield on the left arm can use it only against attacks from the front and <span class=\"No-Break\">left arcs.</span></p><p>Feel free to determine that not all creatures have every type of arc. For example, an amorphous <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ochre-jelly\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"ochre jelly\">ochre jelly</a> could treat all of its arcs as front ones, while a hydra might have three front arcs and one<span class=\"No-Break\"> rear one.</span></p><p>On squares, you pick one side of a creature’s space as the direction it is facing. Draw a diagonal line outward from each corner of this side to determine the squares in its front arc. The opposite side of the space determines its rear arc in the same way. The remaining spaces to either side of the creature form its <span class=\"No-Break\">side arcs.</span></p><p>On hexes, determining the front, rear, and side arcs requires more judgment. Pick one side of the creature’s space and create a wedge shape expanding out from there for the front arc, and another on the opposite side of the creature for the rear arc. The remaining spaces to either side of the creature are its <span class=\"No-Break\">side arcs.</span></p><p>A square or hex might be in more than one arc, depending on how you draw the lines from a creature’s space. If more than half of a square or hex lies in one arc, it is in that arc. If it is split exactly down the middle, use this rule: if half of it lies in the front arc, it’s in that arc. If half of it is in a side arc and the rear arc, it’s in the<span class=\"No-Break\"> side arc.</span></p><h3>Adjudicating Reaction Timing</h3><p>Typical combatants rely on the opportunity attack and the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Ready\">Ready</a> action for most of their reactions in a fight. Various spells and features give a creature more reaction options, and sometimes the timing of a reaction can be difficult to adjudicate. Use this rule of thumb: follow whatever timing is specified in the reaction’s description. For example, the opportunity attack and the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/shield\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"shield\">shield</a></span> spell are clear about the fact that they can interrupt their triggers. If a reaction has no timing specified, or the timing is unclear, the reaction occurs after its trigger finishes, as in the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Ready\">Ready</a> action.</p><h3>Combining Game Effects</h3><p>Different game features can affect a target at the same time. But when two or more game features have the same name, only the effects of one of them—the most potent one—apply while the durations of the effects overlap. For example, if a target is ignited by a fire elemental’s Fire Form trait, the ongoing fire damage doesn’t increase if the burning target is subjected to that trait again. Game features include spells, class features, feats, racial traits, monster abilities, and magic items. See the related rule in the “<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting#CombiningMagicalEffects\">Combining Magical Effects</a>” section of chapter 10 in the <em>Player’s Handbook.</em></p><h2>Chases</h2><p>Strict application of the movement rules can turn a potentially exciting chase into a dull, predictable affair. Faster creatures always catch up to slower ones, while creatures with the same speed never close the distance between each other. This set of rules can make chases more exciting by introducing random<span class=\"No-Break\"> elements.</span></p><h3>Beginning a Chase</h3><p>A chase requires a quarry and at least one pursuer. Any participants not already in initiative order must roll initiative. As in combat, each participant in the chase can take one action and move on its turn. The chase ends when one side drops out or the quarr<span class=\"No-Break\">y escapes.</span></p><p>When a chase begins, determine the starting distance between the quarry and the pursuers. Track the distance between them, and designate the pursuer closest to the quarry as the lead. The lead pursuer might change from round<span class=\"No-Break\"> to round.</span></p><h3>Running the Chase</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/896/c8-22.png\"></p><p>Participants in the chase are strongly motivated to use the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash\">Dash</a> action every round. Pursuers who stop to cast spells and make attacks run the risk of losing their quarry, and a quarry that does so is likely to <span class=\"No-Break\">be caught.</span></p><h4>Dashing</h4><p>During the chase, a participant can freely use the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash\">Dash</a> action a number of times equal to 3 + its Constitution modifier. Each additional <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash\">Dash</a> action it takes during the chase requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution check at the end of its turn or gain one level of e<span class=\"No-Break\">xhaustion.</span></p><p>A participant drops out of the chase if its <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a> reaches level 5, since its speed becomes 0. A creature can remove the levels of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a> it gained during the chase by finishing a short or <span class=\"No-Break\">long rest.</span></p><h4>Spells and Attacks</h4><p>A chase participant can make attacks and cast spells against other creatures within range. Apply the normal rules for cover, terrain, and so on to the attacks a<span class=\"No-Break\">nd spells.</span></p><p>Chase participants can’t normally make opportunity attacks against each other, since they are all assumed to be moving in the same direction at the same time. However, participants can still be the targets of opportunity attacks from creatures not participating in the chase. For example, adventurers who chase a thief past a gang of thugs in an alley might provoke opportunity attacks from <span class=\"No-Break\">the thugs.</span></p><h3>Ending a Chase</h3><p>A chase ends when one side or the other stops, when the quarry escapes, or when the pursuers are close enough to their quarry to<span class=\"No-Break\"> catch it.</span></p><p>If neither side gives up the chase, the quarry makes a Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth\">Stealth</a>) check at the end of each round, after every participant in the chase has taken its turn. The result is compared to the passive Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) scores of the pursuers. If the quarry consists of multiple creatures, they all make <span class=\"No-Break\">the check.</span></p><p>If the quarry is never out of the lead pursuer’s sight, the check fails automatically. Otherwise, if the result of the quarry’s check is greater than the highest passive score, that quarry escapes. If not, the chase continues for anot<span class=\"No-Break\">her round.</span></p><p>The quarry gains advantage or disadvantage on its check based on prevailing circumstances, as shown in the Escape Factors table. If one or more factors give the quarry both advantage and disadvantage on its check, the quarry has neither,<span class=\"No-Break\"> as usual.</span></p><h5>Escape Factors</h5><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Factor</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Check Has …</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Quarry has many things to hide behind</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Advantage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Quarry is in a very crowded or noisy area</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Advantage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Quarry has few things to hide behind</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Disadvantage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Quarry is in an uncrowded or quiet area</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Disadvantage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The lead pursuer is a ranger or has proficiency in <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival\">Survival</a></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Disadvantage</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p>Other factors might help or hinder the quarry’s ability to escape, at your discretion. For example, a quarry with a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/faerie-fire\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"faerie fire\">faerie fire</a></span> spell cast on it might have disadvantage on checks made to escape because it’s much easie<span class=\"No-Break\">r to spot.</span></p><p>Escape doesn’t necessarily mean the quarry has outpaced its pursuers. For example, in an urban setting, escape might mean the quarry ducked into a crowd or slipped around a corner, leaving no clue as to wher<span class=\"No-Break\">e it went.</span></p><h3>Chase Complications</h3><p>As with any good chase scene, complications can arise to make a chase more pulse-pounding. The Urban Chase Complications table and the Wilderness Chase Complications table provide several<span class=\"No-Break\"> examples.</span></p><p>Complications occur randomly. Each participant in the chase rolls a d20 at the end of its turn. Consult the appropriate table to determine whether a complication occurs. If it does, it affects the next chase participant in the initiative order, not the participant who rolled the die. The participant who rolled the die or the participant affected by the complication can spend inspiration to negate the com<span class=\"No-Break\">plication.</span></p><p>Characters can create their own complications to shake off pursuers (for example, casting the <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/web\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"web\">web</a></span> spell in a narrow alleyway). Adjudicate these as yo<span class=\"No-Break\">u see fit.</span></p><h5>Urban Chase Complications</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-816953402\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[TibVzFfYT15WenlU]{Complication}</span></div></div></div><h5>Wilderness Chase Complications</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1779133550\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[ol1vY1acsIIqgwxz]{Complication}</span></div></div></div><h4>Designing Your Own Chase Tables</h4><p>The tables presented here don’t work for all possible environments. A chase through the sewers of Baldur’s Gate or through the spiderweb-filled alleys of Menzoberranzan might inspire you to create your <span class=\"No-Break\">own table.</span></p><h4>Splitting Up</h4><p>Creatures being chased can split up into smaller groups. This tactic forces pursuers to either divide their forces or allow some of the quarry to escape. If a pursuit splits into several smaller chases, resolve each chase separately. Run a round of one chase, then a round of the next, and so on, tracking the distances for each separ<span class=\"No-Break\">ate group.</span></p><h4>Mapping the Chase</h4><p>If you have the opportunity to plan out a chase, take the time to draw a rough map that shows the route. Insert obstacles at specific points, especially ones that require the characters to make ability checks or saving throws to avoid slowing or stopping, or use a random table of complications similar to the ones in this section. Otherwise, improvise as<span class=\"No-Break\"> you play.</span></p><p>Complications can be barriers to progress or opportunities for mayhem. Characters being chased through a forest by <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bugbear\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"bugbear\">bugbear</a><span class=\"plural-monster-tooltip\"><strong>s</strong></span> might spot a wasp nest and slow down long enough to attack the nest or throw rocks at it, thus creating an obstacle for their<span class=\"No-Break\"> pursuers.</span></p><p>A map of a chase can be linear or have many branches, depending on the nature of the chase. For example, a mine cart chase might have few (if any) branches, while a sewer chase might hav<span class=\"No-Break\">e several.</span></p><h4>Role Reversal</h4><p>During a chase, it’s possible for the pursuers to become the quarry. For example, characters chasing a thief through a marketplace might draw unwanted attention from other members of the thieves’ guild. As they pursue the fleeing thief, they must also evade the thieves pursuing them. Roll initiative for the new arrivals, and run both chases simultaneously. In another scenario, the fleeing thief might run into the waiting arms of his accomplices. The outnumbered characters might decide to flee with the thieves i<span class=\"No-Break\">n pursuit.</span></p><h2>Siege Equipment</h2><p>Siege weapons are designed to assail castles and other walled fortifications. They see much use in campaigns that feature war. Most siege weapons don’t move around a battlefield on their own; they require creatures to move them, as well as to load, aim, and <span class=\"No-Break\">fire them.</span></p><h4>Ballista</h4><p><em>Large object</em></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Armor</span><span class=\"No-Break\"><span class=\"bold\"> Class:</span></span></strong><span class=\"No-Break\"> 15</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Hit </span><span class=\"No-Break\"><span class=\"bold\">Points:</span></span></strong><span class=\"No-Break\"> 50</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"bold\">Damage Immunities: </span></strong>poiso<span class=\"No-Break\">n, psychic</span></p><p>A ballista is a massive crossbow that fires heavy bolts.

An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever he cas<span class=\"No-Break\">ts spells.</span></p><p>A simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting of <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lesser-restoration\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"lesser restoration\">lesser restoration</a></span>. A more complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal with the con<span class=\"No-Break\">sequences.</span></p><p>A disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren’t bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What matters is the story you wan<span class=\"No-Break\">t to tell.</span></p><h3>Sample Diseases</h3><p>The diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease can work in the game. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><h4>Cackle Fever</h4><p>This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: “the<span class=\"No-Break\"> shrieks.”</span></p><p>Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a> that can’t be removed until the disease<span class=\"No-Break\"> is cured.</span></p><p>Any event that causes the infected creature great stress — including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare — forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a> with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a> condition on <span class=\"No-Break\">a success.</span></p><p>Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for<span class=\"No-Break\"> 24 hours.</span></p><p>At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described later in thi<span class=\"No-Break\">s chapter.</span></p><h4>Sewer Plague</h4><p>Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/rat\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"rat\">rat</a><span class=\"plural-monster-tooltip\"><strong>s</strong></span> an<span class=\"No-Break\">d <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/otyugh\" data-type=\"monster\" data-name=\"otyugh\">otyugh</a><span class=\"plural-monster-tooltip\"><strong>s</strong></span>.</span></p><p>When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become<span class=\"No-Break\"> infected.</span></p><p>It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague’s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a>, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a <span class=\"No-Break\">long rest.</span></p><p>At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a>. On a successful save, the character’s <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a> level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level of <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\">exhaustion</a> below 1, the creature recovers from th<span class=\"No-Break\">e disease.</span></p><h4>Sight Rot</h4><p>This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds t<span class=\"No-Break\">he victim.</span></p><p>A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature’s vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a −1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches −5, the victim is <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded\">blinded</a> until its sight is restored by magic such as <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lesser-restoration\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"lesser restoration\">lesser restoration</a></span><span class=\"No-Break\"> or </span><span class=\"No-Break\"><span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/heal\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"heal\">heal</a></span></span><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><p>Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease<span class=\"No-Break\"> entirely.</span></p><h2>Poisons</h2><p>Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil <span class=\"No-Break\">creatures.</span></p><p>Poisons come in the following f<span class=\"No-Break\">our types.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Contact.</span></strong> Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.</p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Ingested. </span></strong>A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You might decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a fa<span class=\"No-Break\">iled save.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Inhaled. </span></strong>These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.</p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Injury. </span></strong>Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.</p><div><table class=\"rtg-medium-header-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Item</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Type</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Price per Dose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Assassin’s blood</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Ingested</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">150 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Burnt othur fumes</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Inhaled</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Carrion crawler mucus</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Contact</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">200 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Drow poison</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Injury</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">200 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Essence of ether</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Inhaled</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">300 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Malice</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Inhaled</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">250 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Midnight tears</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Ingested</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Oil of taggit</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Contact</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">400 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Pale tincture</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Ingested</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">250 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Purple worm poison</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Injury</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Serpent venom</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Injury</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">200 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Torpor</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Ingested</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">600 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Truth serum</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Ingested</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">150 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wyvern poison</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Injury</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1,200 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h3>Sample Poisons</h3><p>Each type of poison has its own debilitatin<span class=\"No-Break\">g effects.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Assassin’s Blood</span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"> (Ingested).</span></strong> A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw.

At your discretion, the character can craft other kinds of poison. Not all poison ingredients are available for purchase, and tracking down certain ingredients might form the basis of an entire <span class=\"No-Break\">adventure.</span></p><p>A character can instead attempt to harvest poison from a poisonous creature, such as a snake, wyvern, or carrion crawler.

(Proficiency with the poisoner’s kit applies to this check if the character doesn’t have proficiency in <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Nature\">Nature</a>.) On a successful check, the character harvests enough poison for a single dose. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any poison. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature<span class=\"No-Break\">’s poison.</span></p><h2>Madness</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/898/c8-24.png\"></p><p>In a typical campaign, characters aren’t driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventu<span class=\"No-Break\">rers face.</span></p><h3>Going Mad</h3><p>Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as <span class=\"italic\"> <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/contact-other-plane\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"contact other plane\">contact other plane</a></span> and <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/symbol\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"symbol\">symbol</a></span>, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects in the <span class=\"italic\"><em>Player’s Handbook</em>.</span> Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attune<span class=\"No-Break\">d to them.</span></p><p>Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. If your game includes the Sanity score (see chapter 9, “<a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Workshop\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop\">Dungeon Master’s Workshop</a>”), a creature makes a Sanity saving thro<span class=\"No-Break\">w instead.</span></p><h3>Madness Effects</h3><p>Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinit<span class=\"No-Break\">e madness.</span></p><p>A character afflicted with <span class=\"bold\">short-term madness</span> is subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness table for 1d1<span class=\"No-Break\">0 minutes.</span></p><p>A character afflicted with <span class=\"bold\">long-term madness</span> is subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness table for 1d10 ×<span class=\"No-Break\"> 10 hours.</span></p><p>A character afflicted with <span class=\"bold\">indefinite madness</span> gains a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts un<span class=\"No-Break\">til cured.</span></p><h5>Short-Term Madness</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1215824636\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[YjYtTTTgGXO9Oyil]{Effect lasts 1d10 minutes}</span></div></div></div><h5>Long-Term Madness</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-2109061280\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[kapAwANYRNl5YkTS]{Effect lasts 1d1010 hours}</span></div></div></div><h5>Indefinite Madness</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-655663475\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[oaEzhSnChAkKZzLE]{Flaw lasts until cured}</span></div></div></div><h3>Curing Madness</h3><p>A <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/calm-emotions\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"calm emotions\">calm emotions</a></span> spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lesser-restoration\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"lesser restoration\">lesser restoration</a></span> spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/remove-curse\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"remove curse\">remove curse</a></span> or <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-evil-and-good\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"dispel evil and good\">dispel evil and good</a></span> might also prove effective. A <span class=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/greater-restoration\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"greater restoration\">greater restoration</a></span> spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of indefinit<span class=\"No-Break\">e madness.</span></p><h2>Experience Points</h2><p>Experience points (XP) fuel level advancement for player characters and are most often the reward for completing combat e<span class=\"No-Break\">ncounters.</span></p><p>Each monster has an XP value based on its challenge rating. When adventurers defeat one or more monsters — typically by killing, routing, or capturing them — they divide the total XP value of the monsters evenly among themselves. If the party received substantial assistance from one or more NPCs, count those NPCs as party members when dividing up the XP. (Because the NPCs made the fight easier, individual characters receive <span class=\"No-Break\">fewer XP.)</span></p><p>Chapter 3, \"<a title=\"Creating Adventures\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-adventures\">Creating Adventures</a>\" provides guidelines for designing combat encounters using experien<span class=\"No-Break\">ce points.</span></p><h3>Absent Characters</h3><p>Typically, adventurers earn experience only for encounters they participate in. If a player is absent for a session, the player’s character misses out on the experien<span class=\"No-Break\">ce points.</span></p><p>Over time, you might end up with a level gap between the characters of players who never miss a session and characters belonging to players who are more sporadic in their attendance. Nothing is wrong with that. A gap of two or three levels between different characters in the same party isn’t going to ruin the game for anyone. Some DMs treat XP as a reward for participating in the game, and keeping up with the rest of the party is good incentive for players to attend as many sessions as<span class=\"No-Break\"> possible.</span></p><p>As an alternative, give absent characters the same XP that the other characters earned each session, keeping the group at the same level. Few players will intentionally miss out on the fun of gaming just because they know they’ll receive XP for it even if they don’<span class=\"No-Break\">t show up.</span></p><h3>Noncombat Challenges</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/899/c8-25.png\"></p><p>You decide whether to award experience to characters for overcoming challenges outside combat. If the adventurers complete a tense negotiation with a baron, forge a trade agreement with a clan of surly dwarves, or successfully navigate the Chasm of Doom, you might decide that they deserve an <span class=\"No-Break\">XP reward.</span></p><p>As a starting point, use the rules for building combat encounters in <a title=\"Building Combat Encounters\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-adventures#CreatingaCombatEncounter\">chapter 3</a>&nbsp;to gauge the difficulty of the challenge. Then award the characters XP as if it had been a combat encounter of the same difficulty, but only if the encounter involved a meaningful risk o<span class=\"No-Break\">f failure.</span></p><h3>Milestones</h3><p>You can also award XP when characters complete significant milestones. When preparing your adventure, designate certain events or challenges as milestones, as with the following<span class=\"No-Break\"> examples:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Accomplishing one in a series of goals necessary to complete the <span class=\"No-Break\">adventure.</span></li>\n<li>Discovering a hidden location or piece of information relevant to the <span class=\"No-Break\">adventure.</span></li>\n<li>Reaching an important de<span class=\"No-Break\">stination.</span></li>\n</ul><p>When awarding XP, treat a major milestone as a hard encounter and a minor milestone as an easy <span class=\"No-Break\">encounter.</span></p><p>If you want to reward your players for their progress through an adventure with something more than XP and treasure, give them additional small rewards at milestone points. Here are some<span class=\"No-Break\"> examples:</span></p><ul>\n<li>The adventurers gain the benefit of a s<span class=\"No-Break\">hort rest.</span></li>\n<li>Characters can recover a Hit Die or a low-level s<span class=\"No-Break\">pell slot.</span></li>\n<li>Characters can regain the use of magic items that have had their limited uses<span class=\"No-Break\"> expended.</span></li>\n</ul><h3>Level Advancement without XP</h3><p>You can do away with experience points entirely and control the rate of character advancement. Advance characters based on how many sessions they play, or when they accomplish significant story goals in the campaign. In either case, you tell the players when their characters gai<span class=\"No-Break\">n a level.</span></p><p>This method of level advancement can be particularly helpful if your campaign doesn’t include much combat, or includes so much combat that tracking XP becomes<span class=\"No-Break\"> tiresome.</span></p><h4>Session-Based Advancement</h4><p>A good rate of session-based advancement is to have characters reach 2nd level after the first session of play, 3rd level after another session, and 4th level after two more sessions. Then spend two or three sessions for each subsequent level. This rate mirrors the standard rate of advancement, assuming sessions are about four h<span class=\"No-Break\">ours long.</span></p><h4>Story-Based Advancement</h4><p>When you let the story of the campaign drive advancement, you award levels when adventurers accomplish significant goals in the<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p>","img":null,"_id":"i62Fp1jtFVJ2FINB"}
{"name":" 15 Chapter 9: Dungeon Master’s Workshop","permission":{"default":0,"DJNYgTCLxATVgLjS":3},"flags":{"vtta":{"name":"15 Chapter 9: Dungeon Master’s Workshop","sceneId":null}},"content":"<h1>Chapter 9: Dungeon Master’s Workshop</h1><p><span class=\"caps\">As the Dungeon Master, you aren’t limited</span> by the rules in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em>, the guidelines in these rules, or the selection of monsters in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Monster Manual</span></em>. You can let your imagination run wild. This chapter contains optional rules that you can use to customize your campaign, as well as guidelines on creating your own material, such as monsters and ma<span class=\"No-Break\">gic items.</span></p><p>The options in this chapter relate to many different parts of the game. Some of them are variants of rules, and others are entirely new rules. Each option represents a different genre, style of play, or both. Consider trying no more than one or two of the options at a time so that you can clearly assess their effects on your campaign before adding othe<span class=\"No-Break\">r options.</span></p><p>Before you add a new rule to your campaign, ask yourself two <span class=\"No-Break\">questions:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Will the rule improve<span class=\"No-Break\"> the game?</span></li>\n<li>Will my player<span class=\"No-Break\">s like it?</span></li>\n</ul><p>If you’re confident that the answer to both questions is yes, then you have nothing to lose by giving it a try. Urge your players to provide feedback. If the rule or game element isn’t functioning as intended or isn’t adding much to your game, you can refine it or ditch it. No matter what a rule’s source, a rule serves you, not the other w<span class=\"No-Break\">ay around.</span></p><p>Beware of adding anything to your game that allows a character to concentrate on more than one effect at a time, use more than one reaction or bonus action per round, or attune to more than three magic items at a time. Rules and game elements that override the rules for concentration, reactions, bonus actions, and magic item attunement can seriously unbalance or overcomplicate <span class=\"No-Break\">your game.</span></p><h2>Ability Options</h2><p>The optional rules in this section pertain to using abili<span class=\"No-Break\">ty scores.</span></p><h3>Proficiency Dice</h3><p>This optional rule replaces a character’s proficiency bonus with a proficiency die, adding more randomness to the game and making proficiency a less reliable indicator of mastery. Instead of adding a proficiency bonus to an ability check, an attack roll, or saving throw, the character’s player rolls a die. The Proficiency Die table shows which die or dice to roll, as determined by the characte<span class=\"No-Break\">r’s level.</span></p><p>Whenever a feature, such as the rogue’s Expertise, lets a character double his or her proficiency bonus, the player rolls the character’s proficiency die twice instea<span class=\"No-Break\">d of once.</span></p><p>This option is intended for player characters and nonplayer characters who have levels, as opposed to monsters <span class=\"No-Break\">who don’t.</span></p><h5>Proficiency Die</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1635721726\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[YNzSSoD8gpBn3j6P]{Level: Proficiency Bonus}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1635721727\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[VgX44Gb0vFOHAACR]{Level: Proficiency Die}</span></div></div></div><h3>Skill Variants</h3><p>A skill dictates the circumstances under which a character can add his or her proficiency bonus to an ability check. Skills define those circumstances by referring to different aspects of the six ability scores. For example, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth\">Stealth</a> are two different aspects of Dexterity, and a character can specialize in eithe<span class=\"No-Break\">r or both.</span></p><p>You can dispense with skills and use one of the following variants. Choose whichever one best suits your<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><h4>Ability Check Proficiency</h4><p>With this variant rule, characters don’t have skill proficiencies. Instead, each character has proficiency in two abilities: one tied to the character’s class and one tied to the character’s background. The Ability Proficiencies by Class table suggests a proficiency for each class, and you choose which ability is tied to a given background. Starting at 1st level, a character adds his or her proficiency bonus to any ability check tied to one or the other of these two <span class=\"No-Break\">abilities.</span></p><h5>Ability Check Proficiencies by Class</h5><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Class</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Ability Check</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Barbarian</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Bard</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Any one</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Cleric</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Druid</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Intelligence or Wisdom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Fighter</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Monk</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Paladin</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Strength, Wisdom, or Charisma</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Ranger</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Rogue</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Sorcerer</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Intelligence or Charisma</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Warlock</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Intelligence or Charisma</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wizard</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Intelligence or Wisdom</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p>The Expertise feature works differently than normal under this rule. At 1st level, instead of choosing two skill proficiencies, a character with the Expertise class feature chooses one of the abilities in which he or she has proficiency. Selecting an ability counts as two of the character’s Expertise choices. If the character would gain an additional skill proficiency, that character instead selects another ability check in which to gain pr<span class=\"No-Break\">oficiency.</span></p><p>This option removes skills from the game and doesn’t allow for much distinction among characters. For example, a character can’t choose to emphasize persuasion or intimidation; he or she is equally adep<span class=\"No-Break\">t at both.</span></p><h4>Background Proficiency</h4><p>With this variant rule, characters don’t have skill or tool proficiencies. Anything that would grant the character a skill or tool proficiency provides no benefit. Instead, a character can add his or her proficiency bonus to any ability check to which the character’s prior training and experience (reflected in the character’s background) reasonably applies. The DM is the ultimate judge of whether the character’s backgroun<span class=\"No-Break\">d applies.</span></p><p>For example, the player of a character with the noble background could reasonably argue that the proficiency bonus should apply to a Charisma check the character makes to secure an audience with the king. The player should be encouraged to explain in specific terms how the character’s background applies. Not simply “I’m a noble,” but “I spent three years before starting my adventuring career serving as my family’s ambassador to the court, and this sort of thing is second nature t<span class=\"No-Break\">o me now.”</span></p><p>This simple system relies heavily on players developing their characters’ histories. Don’t let it result in endless debates about whether a character’s proficiency bonus applies in a given situation. Unless a player’s attempt to explain the relevance of the character’s background makes everyone else at the table roll their eyes at its absurdity, go ahead and reward the player for making t<span class=\"No-Break\">he effort.</span></p><p>If a character has the Expertise feature, instead of choosing skills and tools to gain the benefit of that feature, the player defines aspects of his or her background to which the benefit applies. Continuing the noble example, the player might decide to apply Expertise to “situations where courtly manners and etiquette are paramount” and “figuring out the secret plots that court members hatch against one<span class=\"No-Break\"> another.”</span></p><h4>Personality Trait Proficiency</h4><p>With this variant rule, characters don’t have skill proficiencies. Instead, a character can add his or her proficiency bonus to any ability check directly related to the character’s positive personality traits. For example, a character with a positive personality trait of “I never have a plan, but I’m great at making things up as I go along” might apply the bonus when engaging in some off-the-cuff deception to get out of a tight spot. A player should come up with at least four positive personality traits when creating a <span class=\"No-Break\">character.</span></p><p>When a character’s negative personality trait directly impacts an ability check, the character has disadvantage on the check. For example, a hermit whose negative trait is “I often get lost in my own thoughts and contemplation, oblivious to my surroundings” might have disadvantage on an ability check made to notice creatures sn<span class=\"No-Break\">eaking up.</span></p><p>If a character has the Expertise feature, the player can apply its benefit to personality traits related to ability checks, instead of to skills or tools. If a character would gain a new skill or tool proficiency, the character instead gains a new positive personal<span class=\"No-Break\">ity trait.</span></p><p>This system relies heavily on players developing their characters’ personalities. Make sure that different characters’ traits — positive and negative—come into play with about the same frequency. Don’t let a player get away with a positive trait that always seems to apply and a negative trait that n<span class=\"No-Break\">ever does.</span></p><p>At your discretion, you can also tie a character’s ideals, bonds, and flaws to th<span class=\"No-Break\">is system.</span></p><h3>Hero Points</h3><p>Hero points work well in epic fantasy and mythic campaigns in which the characters are meant to be more like superheroes than the average adve<span class=\"No-Break\">nturer is.</span></p><p>With this option, a character starts with 5 hero points at 1st level. Each time the character gains a level, he or she loses any unspent hero points and gains a new total equal to 5 + half the characte<span class=\"No-Break\">r’s level.</span></p><p>A player can spend a hero point whenever he or she makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw. The player can spend the hero point after the roll is made but before any of its results are applied. Spending the hero point allows the player to roll a d6 and add it to the d20, possibly turning a failure into a success. A player can spend only 1 hero point<span class=\"No-Break\"> per roll.</span></p><p>In addition, whenever a character fails a death saving throw, the player can spend one hero point to turn the failure into <span class=\"No-Break\">a success.</span></p><h3>New Ability Scores: Honor and Sanity</h3><p>If you’re running a campaign shaped by a strict code of honor or the constant risk of insanity, consider adding one or both these new ability scores: Honor and Sanity. These abilities function like the standard six abilities, with exceptions specified in each abil<span class=\"No-Break\">ity below.</span></p><p>Here’s how to incorporate these optional abilities at character<span class=\"No-Break\"> creation:</span></p><ul>\n<li>If your players use the standard array of ability scores, add one 11 to the array for each optional abilit<span class=\"No-Break\">y you add.</span></li>\n<li>If your players use the optional point-buy system, add 3 points to the number of points for each optional abilit<span class=\"No-Break\">y you add.</span></li>\n<li>If your players roll their ability scores, have them roll for the added abili<span class=\"No-Break\">ty scores.</span></li>\n</ul><p>If you ever need to make a check or saving throw for Honor or Sanity for a monster that lacks the score, you can use Charisma for Honor and Wisdom f<span class=\"No-Break\">or Sanity.</span></p><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/905/c9-02.png\"></span></p><h4>Honor Score</h4><p>If your campaign involves cultures where a rigid code of honor is part of daily life, consider using the Honor score as a means of measuring a character’s devotion to that code. This ability fits well in a setting inspired by Asian cultures, such as Kara-Tur in the Forgotten Realms. The Honor ability is also useful in any campaign that revolves around orders o<span class=\"No-Break\">f knights.</span></p><p>Honor measures not only a character’s devotion to a code but also the character’s understanding of it. The Honor score can also reflect how others perceive a character’s honor. A character with a high Honor usually has a reputation that others know about, especially those who have high Honor scores t<span class=\"No-Break\">hemselves.</span></p><p>Unlike other abilities, Honor can’t be raised with normal ability score increases. Instead, you can award increases to Honor—or impose reductions—based on a character’s actions. At the end of an adventure, if you think a character’s actions in the adventure reflected well or poorly on his or her understanding of the code, you can increase or decrease the character’s Honor by 1. As with other ability scores, a character’s Honor can’t exceed 20 or fal<span class=\"No-Break\">l below 1.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Honor Checks. </span></strong>Honor checks can be used in social situations, much as Charisma would, when a character’s understanding of a code of conduct is the most defining factor in the way a social interaction will<span class=\"No-Break\"> play out.</span></p><p>You might also call for an Honor check when a character is in one of the following s<span class=\"No-Break\">ituations:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Being unsure how to act <span class=\"No-Break\">with honor</span></li>\n<li>Surrendering while trying to<span class=\"No-Break\"> save face</span></li>\n<li>Trying to determine another character’s H<span class=\"No-Break\">onor score</span></li>\n<li>Trying to use the proper etiquette in a delicate social<span class=\"No-Break\"> situation</span></li>\n<li>Using his or her honorable or dishonorable reputation to influence so<span class=\"No-Break\">meone else</span></li>\n</ul><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"> Honor Saving Throws. </span></strong>An Honor saving throw comes into play when you want to determine whether a character might inadvertently do something dishonorable. You might call for an Honor saving throw in the following s<span class=\"No-Break\">ituations:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Avoiding an accidental breach of honor or<span class=\"No-Break\"> etiquette</span></li>\n<li>Resisting the urge to respond to goading or insults fro<span class=\"No-Break\">m an enemy</span></li>\n<li>Recognizing when an enemy attempts to trick a character into a breac<span class=\"No-Break\">h of honor</span></li>\n</ul><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/906/c9-03.png\"></p><h4>Sanity Score</h4><p>Consider using the Sanity score if your campaign revolves around entities of an utterly alien and unspeakable nature, such as Great Cthulhu, whose powers and minions can shatter a charact<span class=\"No-Break\">er’s mind.</span></p><p>A character with a high Sanity is level-headed even in the face of insane circumstances, while a character with low Sanity is unsteady, breaking easily when confronted by eldritch horrors that are beyond norm<span class=\"No-Break\">al reason.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Sanity Checks. </span></strong>You might ask characters to make a Sanity check in place of an Intelligence check to recall lore about the alien creatures of madness featured in your campaign, to decipher the writings of raving lunatics, or to learn spells from tomes of forbidden lore. You might also call for a Sanity check when a character tries one of the following a<span class=\"No-Break\">ctivities:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Deciphering a piece of text written in a language so alien that it threatens to break a charac<span class=\"No-Break\">ter’s mind</span></li>\n<li>Overcoming the lingering effects <span class=\"No-Break\">of madness</span></li>\n<li>Comprehending a piece of alien magic foreign to all normal understandin<span class=\"No-Break\">g of magic</span></li>\n</ul><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Sanity Saving Throws. </span></strong>You might call for a Sanity saving throw when a character runs the risk of succumbing to madness, such as in the following s<span class=\"No-Break\">ituations:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Seeing a creature from the Far Realm or other alien realms for the <span class=\"No-Break\">first time</span></li>\n<li>Making direct contact with the mind of an alie<span class=\"No-Break\">n creature</span></li>\n<li>Being subjected to spells that affect mental stability, such as the insanity option of the <span class=\"italic\">sy</span><span class=\"No-Break\"><span class=\"italic\">mbol</span></span><span class=\"No-Break\"> spell</span></li>\n<li>Passing through a demiplane built on ali<span class=\"No-Break\">en physics</span></li>\n<li>Resisting an effect conferred by an attack or spell that deals psyc<span class=\"No-Break\">hic damage</span></li>\n</ul><p>A failed Sanity save might result in short-term, long-term, or indefinite madness, as described in chapter 8, \"<a title=\"Running the Game\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/running-the-game\">Running the Game</a>.\" Any time a character suffers from long-term or indefinite madness, the character’s Sanity is reduced by 1. A <span class=\"italic\">greater restoration</span> spell can restore Sanity lost in this way, and a character can increase his or her Sanity through level ad<span class=\"No-Break\">vancement.</span></p><h2>Adventuring Options</h2><p>This section provides options for changing how rests work, as well as for adding unusual things to your campaign, such as moder<span class=\"No-Break\">n weapons.</span></p><h3>Fear and Horror</h3><p>The rules for fear and horror can help you sustain an atmosphere of dread in a dark fantasy<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><h4>Fear</h4><p>When adventurers confront threats they have no hope of overcoming, you can call for them to make a Wisdom saving throw. Set the DC according to the circumstances. A character who fails the save becomes <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\">frightened</a> for 1 minute. The character can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of his or her turns, ending the effect on the character on a succes<span class=\"No-Break\">sful save.</span></p><h4>Horror</h4><p>Horror involves more than simple fright. It entails revulsion and anguish. Often it arises when adventurers see something completely contrary to the common understanding of what can and should occur in the world, or upon the realization of a dread<span class=\"No-Break\">ful truth.</span></p><p>In such a situation, you can call on characters to make a Charisma saving throw to resist the horror. Set the DC based on the magnitude of the horrific circumstances. On a failed save, a character gains a short-term or long-term form of madness that you choose or determine randomly, as detailed in chapter 8, \"<a title=\"Running the Game\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/running-the-game\">Running </a><span class=\"No-Break\"><a title=\"Running the Game\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/running-the-game\">the Game</a>.”</span></p><h3>Healing</h3><p>These optional rules make it easier or harder for adventurers to recover from injury, either increasing or reducing the amount of time your players can spend adventuring before rest is<span class=\"No-Break\"> required.</span></p><h4>Healer’s Kit Dependency</h4><p>A character can’t spend any Hit Dice after finishing a short rest until someone expends one use of a healer’s kit to bandage and treat the character<span class=\"No-Break\">’s wounds.</span></p><h4>Healing Surges</h4><p>This optional rule allows characters to heal up in the thick of combat and works well for parties that feature few or no characters with healing magic, or for campaigns in which magical healin<span class=\"No-Break\">g is rare.</span></p><p>As an action, a character can use a healing surge and spend up to half his or her Hit Dice. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after <span class=\"No-Break\">each roll.</span></p><p>A character who uses a healing surge can’t do so again until he or she finishes a short or <span class=\"No-Break\">long rest.</span></p><p>Under this optional rule, a character regains all spent Hit Dice at the end of a long rest. With a short rest, a character regains Hit Dice equal to his or her level divided by four (minimum of<span class=\"No-Break\"> one die).</span></p><p>For a more superheroic feel, you can let a character use a healing surge as a bonus action, rather than as <span class=\"No-Break\">an action.</span></p><h4>Slow Natural Healing</h4><p>Characters don’t regain hit points at the end of a long rest. Instead, a character can spend Hit Dice to heal at the end of a long rest, just as with a s<span class=\"No-Break\">hort rest.</span></p><p>This optional rule prolongs the amount of time that characters need to recover from their wounds without the benefits of magical healing and works well for grittier, more realistic <span class=\"No-Break\">campaigns.</span></p><h3>Rest Variants</h3><p>The rules for short and long rests presented in <a title=\"Adventuring\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring\">chapter 8</a>&nbsp;of the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em> work well for a heroic-style campaign. Characters can go toe-to-toe with deadly foes, take damage to within an inch of their lives, yet still be ready to fight again the next day. If this approach doesn’t fit your campaign, consider the following<span class=\"No-Break\"> variants.</span></p><h4>Epic Heroism</h4><p>This variant uses a short rest of 5 minutes and a long rest of 1 hour. This change makes combat more routine, since characters can easily recover from every battle. You might want to make combat encounters more difficult to c<span class=\"No-Break\">ompensate.</span></p><p>Spellcasters using this system can afford to burn through spell slots quickly, especially at higher levels. Consider allowing spellcasters to restore expended spell slots equal to only half their maximum spell slots (rounded down) at the end of a long rest, and to limit spell slots restored to 5th level or lower. Only a full 8-hour rest will allow a spellcaster to restore all spell slots and to regain spell slots of 6th level <span class=\"No-Break\">or higher.</span></p><h4>Gritty Realism</h4><p>This variant uses a short rest of 8 hours and a long rest of 7 days. This puts the brakes on the campaign, requiring the players to carefully judge the benefits and drawbacks of combat. Characters can’t afford to engage in too many battles in a row, and all adventuring requires careful<span class=\"No-Break\"> planning.</span></p><p>This approach encourages the characters to spend time out of the dungeon. It’s a good option for campaigns that emphasize intrigue, politics, and interactions among other NPCs, and in which combat is rare or something to be avoided rather than ru<span class=\"No-Break\">shed into.</span></p><h3>Firearms</h3><p>If you want to model the swashbuckling style of <span class=\"italic\">The Three Musketeers</span> and similar tales, you can introduce gunpowder weapons to your campaign that are associated with the Renaissance. Similarly, in a campaign where a spaceship has crashed or elements of modern-day Earth are present, futuristic or modern firearms might appear. The Firearms table provides examples of firearms from all three of those periods. The modern and futuristic items are <span class=\"No-Break\">priceless.</span></p><h4>Proficiency</h4><p>It’s up to you to decide whether a character has proficiency with a firearm. Characters in most D&amp;D worlds wouldn’t have such proficiency. During their downtime, characters can use the training rules in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em> to acquire proficiency, assuming that they have enough ammunition to keep the weapons working while mastering <span class=\"No-Break\">their use.</span></p><h4>Properties</h4><p>Firearms use special ammunition, and some of them have the burst fire or reload<span class=\"No-Break\"> property.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Ammunition.</span></strong> The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Renaissance and modern firearms use bullets. Futuristic firearms are powered by a special type of ammunition called energy cells. An energy cell contains enough power for all the shots its firearm<span class=\"No-Break\"> can make.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Burst Fire.</span></strong> A weapon that has the burst fire property can make a normal single-target attack, or it can spray a 10-foot-cube area within normal range with shots. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the weapon’s normal damage. This action uses ten pieces of a<span class=\"No-Break\">mmunition.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Reload.</span></strong> A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character’<span class=\"No-Break\">s choice).</span></p><h5>Firearms</h5><div><table

explosives from the Renaissance or the modern world (the latter are priceless), as presented in the Explosi<span class=\"No-Break\">ves table.</span></p><h4>Bomb</h4><p>As an action, a character can light this bomb and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 fi<span class=\"No-Break\">re damage.</span></p><h4>Gunpowder</h4><p>Gunpowder is chiefly used to propel a bullet out of the barrel of a pistol or rifle, or it is formed into a bomb. Gunpowder is sold in small wooden kegs and in water-resistant pow<span class=\"No-Break\">der horns.</span></p><p>Setting fire to a container full of gunpowder can cause it to explode, dealing fire damage to creatures within 10 feet of it (3d6 for a powder horn, 7d6 for a keg). A successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage. Setting fire to an ounce of gunpowder causes it to flare for 1 round, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additiona<span class=\"No-Break\">l 30 feet.</span></p><h4>Dynamite</h4><p>As an action, a creature can light a stick of dynamite and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a succe<span class=\"No-Break\">ssful one.</span></p><p>A character can bind sticks of dynamite together so they explode at the same time. Each additional stick increases the damage by 1d6 (to a maximum of 10d6) and the burst radius by 5 feet (to a maximum of<span class=\"No-Break\"> 20 feet).</span></p><p>Dynamite can be rigged with a longer fuse to explode after a set amount of time, usually 1 to 6 rounds. Roll initiative for the dynamite. After the set number of rounds goes by, the dynamite explodes on that i<span class=\"No-Break\">nitiative.</span></p><h4>Grenades</h4><p>As an action, a character can throw a grenade at a point up to 60 feet away. With a grenade launcher, the character can propel the grenade up to 120 <span class=\"No-Break\">feet away.</span></p><p>Each creature within 20 feet of an exploding <span class=\"bold\">fragmentation grenade</span> must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a succe<span class=\"No-Break\">ssful one.</span></p><p>One round after a <span class=\"bold\">smoke grenade</span> lands, it emits a cloud of smoke that creates a heavily obscured area in a 20-foot radius.

To simulate a character’s ignorance about the technology, have the character make a series of Intelligence checks to figu<span class=\"No-Break\">re it out.</span></p><p>To determine how the technology works, a character must succeed on a number of Intelligence checks based on the complexity of the item: two successes for a simple item (such as a cigarette lighter, calculator, or revolver) and four successes for a complex item (such as a computer, chainsaw, or hovercraft). Then consult the Figuring Out Alien Technology table. Consider making the item break if a character fails four or more times before taking a <span class=\"No-Break\">long rest.</span></p><p>A character who has seen an item used or has operated a similar item has advantage on Intelligence checks made to figure ou<span class=\"No-Break\">t its use.</span></p><h5>Figuring Out Alien Technology</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1772613347\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[AQOmwMziB34vdRJk]{Result}</span></div></div></div><h3>Plot Points</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/916/c9-04.png\"></p><p>Plot points allow players to change the course of the campaign, introduce plot complications, alter the world, and even assume the role of the DM. If your first reaction to reading this optional rule is to worry that your players might abuse it, it’s probably no<span class=\"No-Break\">t for you.</span></p><h4>Using Plot Points</h4><p>Each player starts with 1 plot point. During a session, a player can spend that point for one effect. The effect depends on your group’s approach to this optional rule. Three options are presen<span class=\"No-Break\">ted below.</span></p><p>A player can spend no more than 1 plot point per session. You can increase this limit if you like, especially if you want the players to drive more of the story. Once every player at the table has spent a plot point, they each gain 1 p<span class=\"No-Break\">lot point.</span></p><h4>Option 1: What a Twist!</h4><p>A player who spends a plot point gets to add some element to the setting or situation that the group (including you) must accept as true. For example, a player can spend a plot point and state that his or her character has found a secret door, an NPC appears, or a monster turns out to be a long-lost ally polymorphed into a hor<span class=\"No-Break\">rid beast.</span></p><p>A player who wants to spend a plot point in this way should take a minute to discuss his or her idea with everyone else at the table and get feedback before settling on a plot de<span class=\"No-Break\">velopment.</span></p><h4>Option 2: The Plot Thickens</h4><p>Whenever a player spends a plot point, the player to his or her right must add a complication to the scene. For example, if the player who spends the plot point decides that her character has found a secret door, the player to the right might state that opening the door triggers a magical trap that teleports the party to another part of th<span class=\"No-Break\">e dungeon.</span></p><h4>Option 3: The Gods Must Be Crazy</h4><p>With this approach, there is no permanent DM. Everyone makes a character, and one person starts as the DM and runs the game as normal. That person’s character becomes an NPC who can tag along with the group or remain on the sidelines, as the gro<span class=\"No-Break\">up wishes.</span></p><p>At any time, a player can spend a plot point to become the DM. That player’s character becomes an NPC, and play continues. It’s probably not a good idea to swap roles in the middle of combat, but it can happen if your group allows time for the new DM to settle into his or her role and pick up where the previous DM<span class=\"No-Break\"> left off.</span></p><p>Using plot points in this way can make for an exciting campaign as each new DM steers the game in unexpected directions. This approach is also a great way for would-be DMs to try running a game in small, control<span class=\"No-Break\">led doses.</span></p><p>In a campaign that uses plot points this way, everyone should come to the table with a bit of material prepared or specific encounters in mind. A player who isn’t prepared or who doesn’t feel like DMing can choose to not spend a plot point tha<span class=\"No-Break\">t session.</span></p><p>For this approach to work, it’s a good idea to establish some shared assumptions about the campaign so that DMs aren’t duplicating efforts or trampling on each othe<span class=\"No-Break\">r’s plans.</span></p><h2>Combat Options</h2><p>The options in this section provide alternative ways to handle combat. The main risk of adding some of these rules is slowing <span class=\"No-Break\">down play.</span></p><h3>Initiative Variants</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/908/c9-05.png\"></p><p>This section offers different ways to handle i<span class=\"No-Break\">nitiative.</span></p><h4>Initiative Score</h4><p>With this optional rule, creature don’t roll initiative at the start of combat. Instead, each creature has an initiative score, which is a passive Dexterity check: 10&nbsp;+&nbsp;Dexterity<span class=\"No-Break\"> modifier.</span></p><p>By cutting down on die rolls, math done on the fly, and the process of asking for and recording totals, you can speed your game up considerably—at the cost of an initiative order that is often pr<span class=\"No-Break\">edictable.</span></p><h4>Side Initiative</h4><p>Recording initiative for each PC and monster, arranging everyone in the correct order, and remembering where you are in the list can bog the game down. If you want quicker combats, at the risk of those combats becoming unbalanced, try using the side initia<span class=\"No-Break\">tive rule.</span></p><p>Under this variant, the players roll a d20 for their initiative as a group, or side. You also roll a d20. Neither roll receives any modifiers. Whoever rolls highest wins initiative. In case of a tie, keep rerolling until the tie <span class=\"No-Break\">is broken.</span></p><p>When it’s a side’s turn, the members of that side can act in any order they choose. Once everyone on the side has taken a turn, the other side goes. A round ends when both sides have completed th<span class=\"No-Break\">eir turns.</span></p><p>If more than two sides take part in a battle, each side rolls for initiative. Sides act from the highest roll to lowest. Combat continues in the initiative order until the battle is<span class=\"No-Break\"> complete.</span></p><p>This variant encourages teamwork and makes your life as a DM easier, since you can more easily coordinate monsters. On the downside, the side that wins initiative can gang up on enemies and take them out before they have a chan<span class=\"No-Break\">ce to act.</span></p><h4>Speed Factor</h4><p>Some DMs find the regular progression of initiative too predictable and prone to abuse. Players can use their knowledge of the initiative order to influence their decisions. For example, a badly wounded fighter might charge a troll because he knows that the cleric goes before the monster and can<span class=\"No-Break\"> heal him.</span></p><p>Speed factor is an option for initiative that introduces more uncertainty into combat, at the cost of speed of play. Under this variant, the participants in a battle roll initiative each round. Before rolling, each character or monster must choose <span class=\"No-Break\">an action.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Initiative Modifiers. </span></strong>Modifiers might apply to a creature’s initiative depending on its size and the action it takes. For example, a creature that fights with a light weapon or casts a simple spell is more likely to act before a creature armed with a heavy or slow weapon. See the Speed Factor Initiative Modifiers table for details. If an action has no modifier listed, the action has no effect on initiative. If more than one modifier applies (such as wielding a two-handed, heavy melee weapon), apply them all to the initia<span class=\"No-Break\">tive roll.</span></p><h5>Speed Factor Initiative Modifiers</h5><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Factor</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Initiative Modifier</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Spellcasting</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Subtract the spell’s level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Melee, heavy weapon</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">−2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Melee, light or finesse weapon</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Melee, two-handed weapon</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">−2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Ranged, loading weapon</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">−5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Creature Size</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Initiative Modifier</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Tiny</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Small</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Medium</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Large</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">−2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Huge</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">−5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Gargantuan</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">−8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p>Don’t apply the same modifier more than once on a creature’s turn. For example, a rogue fighting with two daggers gains the +2 bonus for using a light or finesse weapon only once. In the case of spellcasting, apply only the modifier from the highest-le<span class=\"No-Break\">vel spell.</span></p><p>Apply any modifiers for bonus actions to that creature’s turn, remembering never to apply the same modifier twice. For instance, a paladin casts a 2nd-level spell as a bonus action and then attacks with a shortsword. The paladin takes a −2 penalty for the spell and gains a +2 bonus for using a light weapon, for a total modif<span class=\"No-Break\">ier of +0.</span></p><p>The table is only a starting point. You can refer to it when adjudicating any actions a character takes that you think should be faster or slower. Quick, easy actions should grant a bonus, while slow, difficult ones should incur a penalty. As a rule of thumb, apply a bonus or penalty of 2 or 5 for <span class=\"No-Break\">an action.</span></p><p>For example, a fighter wants to turn a winch to raise a portcullis. This is a complex, difficult action. You could rule that it incurs a −5 initiativ<span class=\"No-Break\">e penalty.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Rolling Initiative. </span></strong>After deciding on an action, everyone rolls initiative and applies modifiers, keeping the result secret. You then announce an initiative number, starting with 30 and working down (it helps to call out ranges of numbers at the start). Break any ties by having the combatant with the highest Dexterity act first. Otherwise, roll to determine who g<span class=\"No-Break\">oes first.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Turns. </span></strong>On its turn, a creature moves as normal but must take the action it selected or take no acti<span class=\"No-Break\">on at all.</span></p><p>Once everyone has acted, the process repeats. Everyone in the battle selects an action, rolls initiative, and takes turns<span class=\"No-Break\"> in order.</span></p><h3>Action Options</h3><p>This section provides new action options for combat. They can be added as a group or individually to <span class=\"No-Break\">your game.</span></p><h4>Climb onto a Bigger Creature</h4><p>If one creature wants to jump onto another creature, it can do so by grappling. A Small or Medium creature has little chance of making a successful grapple against a Huge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless magic has granted the grappler supernatu<span class=\"No-Break\">ral might.</span></p><p>As an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability checks necessary to get into position and onto the larger creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make a Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) or Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>) check contested by the target’s Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>) check. If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature’s space and clings to its body. While in the target’s space, the smaller creature moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls a<span class=\"No-Break\">gainst it.</span></p><p>The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature’s space, treating the space as difficult terrain. The larger creature’s ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature’s location, and is left to your discretion. The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action—knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it—by making a Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) check contested by the smaller creature’s Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) or Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>) check. The smaller creature chooses which abili<span class=\"No-Break\">ty to use.</span></p><h4>Disarm</h4><p>A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target’s grasp. The attacker makes an attack roll contested by the target’s Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) check or Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>) check. If the attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the defender drops<span class=\"No-Break\"> the item.</span></p><p>The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it i<span class=\"No-Break\">s smaller.</span></p><h4>Mark</h4><p>This option makes it easier for melee combatants to harry each other with opportunit<span class=\"No-Break\">y attacks.</span></p><p>When a creature makes a melee attack, it can also mark its target. Until the end of the attacker’s next turn, any opportunity attack it makes against the marked target has advantage. The opportunity attack doesn’t expend the attacker’s reaction, but the attacker can’t make the attack if anything, such as the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a> condition or the <span class=\"italic\">shocking grasp</span> spell, is preventing it from taking reactions. The attacker is limited to one opportunity attack<span class=\"No-Break\"> per turn.</span></p><h4>Overrun</h4><p>When a creature tries to move through a hostile creature’s space, the mover can try to force its way through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an action or a bonus action, the mover makes a Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) check contested by the hostile creature’s Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) check. The creature attempting the overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than the hostile creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller. If the mover wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature’s space once <span class=\"No-Break\">this turn.</span></p><h4>Shove Aside</h4><p>With this option, a creature uses the special shove attack from the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em> to force a target to the side, rather than away. The attacker has disadvantage on its Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\">Athletics</a>) check when it does so. If that check is successful, the attacker moves the target 5 feet to a different space within <span class=\"No-Break\">its reach.</span></p><h4>Tumble</h4><p>A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature’s space, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As an action or a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>) check contested by the hostile creature’s Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>) check. If the tumbler wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature’s space once <span class=\"No-Break\">this turn.</span></p><h3>Hitting Cover</h3><p>When a ranged attack misses a target that has cover, you can use this optional rule to determine whether the cover was struck by t<span class=\"No-Break\">he attack.</span></p><p>First, determine whether the attack roll would have hit the protected target without the cover. If the attack roll falls within a range low enough to miss the target but high enough to strike the target if there had been no cover, the object used for cover is struck. If a creature is providing cover for the missed creature and the attack roll exceeds the AC of the covering creature, the covering creature is hit.</p><h3>Cleaving through Creatures</h3><p>If your player characters regularly fight hordes of lower-level monsters, consider using this optional rule to help speed up su<span class=\"No-Break\">ch fights.</span></p><p>When a melee attack reduces an undamaged creature to 0 hit points, any excess damage from that attack might carry over to another creature nearby. The attacker targets another creature within reach and, if the original attack roll can hit it, applies any remaining damage to it. If that creature was undamaged and is likewise reduced to 0 hit points, repeat this process, carrying over the remaining damage until there are no valid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to reduce an undamaged creature to 0 h<span class=\"No-Break\">it points.</span></p><h3>Injuries</h3><p>Damage normally leaves no lingering effects. This option introduces the potential for long-term<span class=\"No-Break\"> injuries.</span></p><p>It’s up to you to decide when to check for a lingering injury. A creature might sustain a lingering injury under the following circ<span class=\"No-Break\">umstances:</span></p><ul>\n<li>When it takes a cr<span class=\"No-Break\">itical hit</span></li>\n<li>When it drops to 0 hit points but isn’t kille<span class=\"No-Break\">d outright</span></li>\n<li>When it fails a death saving throw by<span class=\"No-Break\"> 5 or more</span></li>\n</ul><p>To determine the nature of the injury, roll on the Lingering Injuries table. This table assumes a typical humanoid physiology, but you can adapt the results for creatures with different b<span class=\"No-Break\">ody types.</span></p><h5>Lingering Injuries</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1350844891\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[aUbxRKQWReSHVIph]{Injury}</span></div></div></div><p>Instead of using the effect described in the table, you can put the responsibility of representing a character’s lingering injury in the hands of the player. Roll on the Lingering Injuries table as usual, but instead of suffering the effect described for that result, that character gains a new flaw with the same name. It’s up to the player to express the lingering injury during play, just like any other flaw, with the potential to gain inspiration when the injury affects the character in a meani<span class=\"No-Break\">ngful way.</span></p><h3>Massive Damage</h3><p>This optional rule makes it easier for a creature to be felled by massi<span class=\"No-Break\">ve damage.</span></p><p>When a creature takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than half its hit point maximum, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer a random effect determined by a roll on the System Shock table. For example, a creature that has a hit point maximum of 30 must make that Constitution save if it takes 15 damage or more from a sing<span class=\"No-Break\">le source.</span></p><h5>System Shock</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"1036897126\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[HRUnrCgCYPlJVtAj]{Effect}</span></div></div></div><h3>Morale</h3><p>Some combatants might run away when a fight turns against them. You can use this optional rule to help determine when monsters and <span class=\"No-Break\">NPCs flee.</span></p><p>A creature might flee under any of the following circ<span class=\"No-Break\">umstances:</span></p><ul>\n<li>The creature is <span class=\"No-Break\">surprised.</span></li>\n<li>The creature is reduced to half its hit points or fewer for the first time in t<span class=\"No-Break\">he battle.</span></li>\n<li>The creature has no way to harm the opposing side on<span class=\"No-Break\"> its turn.</span></li>\n</ul><p>A group of creatures might flee under any of the following circ<span class=\"No-Break\">umstances:</span></p><ul>\n<li>All the creatures in the group are <span class=\"No-Break\">surprised.</span></li>\n<li>The group’s leader is reduced to 0 hit points, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\">incapacitated</a>, taken prisoner, or removed fr<span class=\"No-Break\">om battle.</span></li>\n<li>The group is reduced to half its original size with no losses on the oppo<span class=\"No-Break\">sing side.</span></li>\n</ul><p>To determine whether a creature or group of creatures flees, make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw for the creature or the group’s leader. If the opposition is overwhelming, the saving throw is made with disadvantage, or you can decide that the save fails automatically. If a group’s leader can’t make the saving throw for whatever reason, have the creature in the group with the next highest Charisma score make the saving thro<span class=\"No-Break\">w instead.</span></p><p>On a failed save, the affected creature or group flees by the most expeditious route. If escape is impossible, the creature or group surrenders. If a creature or group that surrenders is attacked by its conquerors, the battle might resume, and it’s unlikely that further attempts to flee or surrender wil<span class=\"No-Break\">l be made.</span></p><p>A failed saving throw isn’t always to the adventurers’ benefit. For example, an ogre that flees from combat might put the rest of the dungeon on alert or run off with treasure that the characters had hoped t<span class=\"No-Break\">o plunder.</span></p><h2>Creating a Monster</h2><p>The&nbsp;<em>Monster Manual</em>&nbsp;contains hundreds of ready-to-play monsters, but it doesn’t include every monster that you can imagine. Part of the D&amp;D experience is the simple joy of creating new monsters and customizing existing ones, if for no other reason than to surprise and delight your players with something they’ve never fac<span class=\"No-Break\">ed before.</span></p><p>The first step in the process is coming up with the concept for your monster. What makes it unique? Where does it live? What role do you want it to serve in your adventure, your campaign, or your world? What does it look like? Does it have any weird abilities? Once you have the answers to these questions, you can start figuring out how to represent your monster in<span class=\"No-Break\"> the game.</span></p><h3>Modifying a Monster</h3><p>Once you have an idea for a monster, you’ll need statistics to represent it. The first question you should ask yourself is: Can I use statistics that alre<span class=\"No-Break\">ady exist?</span></p><p>A stat block in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Manual</em>&nbsp;might make a good starting point for your monster. Imagine, for example, that you want to create an intelligent arboreal predator that hunts elves. There is no such monster in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Monster Manual</span></em>, but the quaggoth is a savage humanoid predator with a climbing speed. You could borrow the quaggoth stat block for your new monster, changing nothing but the creature’s name. You can also make minor tweaks, such as replacing the quaggoth’s language, Undercommon, with one that’s more appropriate, such as Elvish <span class=\"No-Break\">or Sylvan.</span></p><p>Need a fiery phoenix? Take the giant eagle or roc, give it immunity to fire, and allow it to deal fire damage with its attacks. Need a flying monkey? Consider a baboon with wings and a flying speed. Almost any monster you can imagine can be built using one that alrea<span class=\"No-Break\">dy exists.</span></p><p>Adapting a stat block is far less time-consuming than creating one from scratch, and there are changes you can make to an existing monster that have no effect on its challenge rating, such as swapping languages, changing its alignment, or adding special senses. However, once you change the creature’s offensive or defensive ability, such as its hit points or damage, its challenge rating might need to change, as sh<span class=\"No-Break\">own later.</span></p><h4>Switching Weapons</h4><p>If a monster wields a manufactured weapon, you can replace that weapon with a different one. For example, you could replace a hobgoblin’s longsword with a halberd. Don’t forget to change the damage and the attack’s reach where appropriate. Also be aware of the consequences of switching from a one-handed weapon to a two-handed weapon, or vice versa. For example, a hobgoblin wielding a halberd (a two-handed weapon) loses the benefit of its shield, so its AC decre<span class=\"No-Break\">ases by 2.</span></p><h4>Adding a Special Trait</h4><p>Another simple way to customize a monster is to add a special trait. You can add a special trait of your own devising or pick up a special trait from one of the many creatures in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Manual</em>. For example, you can create a goblin-spider hybrid by giving the normal goblin the Spider Climb special trait, turn an ordinary troll into a two-headed troll by giving it the Two Heads special trait, or turn an owlbear into a flying owlbear by giving it wings and a giant owl’s fly<span class=\"No-Break\">ing speed.</span></p><h3>Creating Quick Monster Stats</h3><p>If all you need are simple stats for a monster of a particular challenge rating, follow the steps here. If you want to create something more akin to the monster stat blocks in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Monster Manual</span></em>, skip ahead to “<a title=\"Creating a Monster Stat Block\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#CreatingaMonsterStatBlock\">Creating a Monster Stat Block</a><span class=\"No-Break\">.\"</span></p><h4>Step 1. Expected Challenge Rating</h4><p>Pick the expected challenge rating (CR) for your monster. Knowing the monster’s expected challenge rating will help you figure out the monster’s proficiency bonus and other important combat statistics. Don’t worry about getting the challenge rating exactly right; you can make adjustments in la<span class=\"No-Break\">ter steps.</span></p><p>A single monster with a challenge rating equal to the adventurers’ level is, by itself, a fair challenge for a group of four characters. If the monster is meant to be fought in pairs or groups, its expected challenge rating should be lower than the part<span class=\"No-Break\">y’s level.</span></p><p>Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that your monster must have a challenge rating equal to the level of the characters to be a worthy challenge. Keep in mind that monsters with a lower challenge rating can be a threat to higher-level characters when encountered <span class=\"No-Break\">in groups.</span></p><h5>Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"974153309\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[NliffXyoRiZ2LAAs]{, CR: , CR}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"974153310\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[Wf53luwoDRyHETDr]{, CR: , ProfBonus}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"974153311\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[53B9iIeJOjag3d9D]{, CR: Defensive, Armor Class}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"974153312\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[ZCHPLCcVhbNxtWrw]{, CR: Defensive, Hit Points}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"974153313\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[uplgrbpfSTuMv8wK]{, CR: Offensive, Attack Bonus}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"974153314\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[oyNSJhcqKW6WlLDC]{, CR: Offensive, DamageRound}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"974153315\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[3dfCj5w2aU5g6xio]{, CR: Offensive, Save DC}</span></div></div></div><h4>Step 2. Basic Statistics</h4><p>Use the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine the monster’s Armor Class, hit points, attack bonus, and damage output per round based on the challenge rating you chose <span class=\"No-Break\">in step 1.</span></p><h4>Step 3. Adjust Statistics</h4><p>Raise or lower the monster’s Armor Class, hit points, attack bonus, damage output per round, and save DC as you see fit, based on whatever concept you have in mind for the monster. For example, if you need a well-armored monster, increase its Ar<span class=\"No-Break\">mor Class.</span></p><p>Once you’ve made the desired adjustments, record the monster’s statistics. If there are any other statistics you think the monster needs (such as ability scores), follow the appropriate steps under “Creating a Monster St<span class=\"No-Break\">at Block.”</span></p><h4>Step 4. Final Challenge Rating</h4><p>Calculate the monster’s final challenge rating, accounting for the adjustments you made <span class=\"No-Break\">in step 3.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Defensive Challenge Rating.</span></strong> Read down the Hit Points column of the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table until you find your monster’s hit points. Then look across and note the challenge rating suggested for a monster with those h<span class=\"No-Break\">it points.</span></p><p>Now look at the Armor Class suggested for a monster of that challenge rating. If your monster’s AC is at least two points higher or lower than that number, adjust the challenge rating suggested by its hit points up or down by 1 for every 2 points of d<span class=\"No-Break\">ifference.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Offensive Challenge Rating. </span></strong>Read down the Damage/Round column of the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table until you find your monster’s damage output per round. Then look across and note the challenge rating suggested for a monster that deals that mu<span class=\"No-Break\">ch damage.</span></p><p>Now look at the attack bonus suggested for a monster of that challenge rating. If your monster’s attack bonus is at least two points higher or lower than that number, adjust the challenge rating suggested by its damage output up or down by 1 for every 2 points of d<span class=\"No-Break\">ifference.</span></p><p>If the monster relies more on effects with saving throws than on attacks, use the monster’s save DC instead of its att<span class=\"No-Break\">ack bonus.</span></p><p>If your monster uses different attack bonuses or save DCs, use the ones that will come up the m<span class=\"No-Break\">ost often.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Average Challenge Rating. </span></strong>The monster’s final challenge rating is the average of its defensive and offensive challenge ratings. Round the average up or down to the nearest challenge rating to determine your monster’s final challenge rating. For example, if the creature’s defensive challenge rating is 2 and its offensive rating is 3, its final ra<span class=\"No-Break\">ting is 3.</span></p><p>With the final challenge rating, you can determine the monster’s proficiency bonus using the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table. Use the Experience Points by Challenge Rating table to determine how much XP the monster is worth. A monster of challenge rating 0 is worth 0 XP if it poses no threat. Otherwise, it is wo<span class=\"No-Break\">rth 10 XP.</span></p><p>Creating a monster isn’t just a number-crunching exercise. The guidelines in this chapter can help you create monsters, but the only way to know whether a monster is fun is to playtest it. After seeing your monster in action, you might want to adjust the challenge rating up or down based on your ex<span class=\"No-Break\">periences.</span></p><h5>Experience Points by Challenge Rating</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-336470787\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[YwAgG3lVtBIMY1Kw]{XP}</span></div></div></div><h3>Creating a Monster Stat Block</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/909/c9-06.png\"></p><p>If you want a full monster stat block, use the following method to create your ne<span class=\"No-Break\">w monster.</span></p><p>The introduction to the <em><span class=\"italic\">Monster Manual</span></em> explains all the components of a monster’s stat block. Familiarize yourself with that material before you begin. In the course of creating your monster, if you find yourself unable to make a decision, let the examples in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Manual</em>&nbsp;<span class=\"No-Break\">guide you.</span></p><p>Once you have a monster concept in mind, follow the st<span class=\"No-Break\">eps below.</span></p><h4>Step 1. Name</h4><p>A monster’s name should be given as much consideration as any other aspect of the monster, if<span class=\"No-Break\"> not more.</span></p><p>Your monster might be based on a real-world creature or a monster from myth, in which case its name might be obvious. If you need to invent a name, keep in mind that the best names either reflect the monster’s appearance or nature (such as the mimic and the owlbear) or have a nice ring to them (such as the chuul and the th<span class=\"No-Break\">ri-kreen).</span></p><h4>Step 2. Size</h4><p>Make your monster whatever size you want: Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or G<span class=\"No-Break\">argantuan.</span></p><p>A monster’s size determines which die is used to calculate its hit points in step 8. Size also determines how much space the monster occupies, as discussed in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s</span><span class=\"No-Break\"><span class=\"italic\"> Handbook</span></span></em><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><h4>Step 3. Type</h4><p>A monster’s type provides insight into its origins and nature. The <em><span class=\"italic\">Monster Manual</span></em> describes each monster type. Choose the type that best fits your concept for th<span class=\"No-Break\">e monster.</span></p><h4>Step 4. Alignment</h4><p>If your monster has no concept of morals, it is unaligned. Otherwise, it has an alignment appropriate to its nature and moral outlook, as discussed in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s</span><span class=\"No-Break\"><span class=\"italic\"> Handbook</span></span></em><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><h4>Step 5. Ability Scores and Modifiers</h4><p>Monsters, like player characters, have the six ability scores. A monster can’t have a score lower than 1 or higher than 30 in an<span class=\"No-Break\">y ability.</span></p><p>A monster’s score in any ability determines its ability modifier, as shown in the Ability Scores and Modifiers table in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s</span><span class=\"No-Break\"><span class=\"italic\"> Handbook</span></span></em><span class=\"No-Break\">.</span></p><p>If you can’t decide what a monster’s ability scores should be, look for comparable monsters in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Manual</em>&nbsp;and mimic their ability scores. For example, if your monster is roughly as smart as a human commoner, give it an Intelligence of 10 (+0 modifier). If it’s as strong as an ogre, give it a Strength of 19 (+4 <span class=\"No-Break\">modifier).</span></p><h4>Step 6. Expected Challenge Rating</h4><p>Choose a challenge rating for your monster. See step 1 under “Creating Quick Monster Stats” for more information. You will use the proficiency bonus in later steps, so jot it down now or re<span class=\"No-Break\">member it.</span></p><h4>Step 7. Armor Class</h4><p>A monster’s Armor Class has a direct bearing on its challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine your monster’s Armor Class in one of<span class=\"No-Break\"> two ways.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Use the Table. </span></strong>You can choose an appropriate AC based on the monster’s expected challenge rating, as shown in the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table. The table provides the baseline AC for a monster of a specific challenge rating. Feel free to adjust the AC as you see fit. For example, the baseline AC for a challenge rating 1 monster is 13, but if your monster is well armored, raise its AC accordingly. Don’t worry if the monster’s AC isn’t matching up with the expected challenge rating for the monster. Other factors can affect a monster’s challenge rating, as shown in la<span class=\"No-Break\">ter steps.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Determine an Appropriate AC.</span></strong> Alternatively, you can determine an appropriate AC based on the type of armor the monster wears, its natural armor, or some other Armor Class booster (such as the <span class=\"italic\">mage armor</span> spell). Again, don’t worry if the monster’s AC isn’t matching up with the expected challenge rating for th<span class=\"No-Break\">e monster.</span></p><p>If your monster wears manufactured armor, its Armor Class is based on the type of armor worn (see <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#ArmorandShields\">chapter 5</a>&nbsp;of the <em>Player's Handbook</em>&nbsp;for armor types). If the monster carries a shield, apply the shield bonus to its AC <span class=\"No-Break\">as normal.</span></p><p>A monster that doesn’t wear armor might have natural armor, in which case it has an AC equal to 10 + its Dexterity modifier + its natural armor bonus. A monster with a thick hide generally has a natural armor bonus of +1 to +3. The bonus can be higher if the creature is exceptionally well armored. A gorgon, for example, is covered in steely plates and has a natural armor bo<span class=\"No-Break\">nus of +9.</span></p><h4>Step 8. Hit Points</h4><p>A monster’s hit points have a direct bearing on its challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine your monster’s hit points in one of<span class=\"No-Break\"> two ways.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Use the Table.</span></strong> You can start with the monster’s expected challenge rating and use the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine an appropriate number of hit points. The table presents a range of hit points for each challen<span class=\"No-Break\">ge rating.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Assign Hit Dice.</span></strong> Alternatively, you can assign a number of Hit Dice to a monster, then calculate its average hit points. Don’t worry if the hit points aren’t matching up with the expected challenge rating for the monster. Other factors can affect a monster’s challenge rating, as shown in later steps, and you can always adjust a monster’s Hit Dice and hit points<span class=\"No-Break\"> later on.</span></p><p>A monster can have as many Hit Dice as you want, but the size of the die used to calculate its hit points depends on the monster’s size, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table. For example, a Medium monster uses d8s for hit points, so a Medium monster with 5 Hit Dice and a Constitution of 13 (+1 modifier) has 5d8 + 5 h<span class=\"No-Break\">it points.</span></p><p>A monster typically has average hit points based on its Hit Dice. For example, a creature with 5d8 + 5 hit points has an average of 27 hit points (5 ×<span class=\"No-Break\"> 4.5 + 5).</span></p><h5>Hit Dice by Size</h5><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table-2\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Monster Size</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Hit Die</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Average HP per Die</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Tiny</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">d4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2½</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Small</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">d6</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">3½</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Medium</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">d8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4½</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Large</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">d10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">5½</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Huge</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">d12</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">6½</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Gargantuan</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">d20</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">10½</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h4>Step 9. Damage Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities</h4><p>Decide whether your monster has vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to one or more types of damage (see the <a title=\"Damage Types\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat#DamageTypes\">Combat</a> section of the&nbsp;<em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em> for descriptions of the various damage types). Assign a vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to a monster only when it’s intuitive. For example, it makes sense for a monster made of molten lava to have immunity to fi<span class=\"No-Break\">re damage.</span></p><p>Giving a monster resistances and immunities to three or more damage types (especially bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage) is like giving it extra hit points. However, adventurers have more resources at higher levels to counteract such defenses, making resistances and immunities less relevant at high<span class=\"No-Break\">er levels.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Effective Hit Points.</span></strong> If a monster has resistance or immunity to several damage types—especially bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons—and not all the characters in the party possess the means to counteract that resistance or immunity, you need to take these defenses into account when comparing your monster’s hit points to its expected challenge rating. Using the Effective Hit Points Based on Resistances and Immunities table, apply the appropriate multiplier to the monster’s hit points to determine its effective hit points for the purpose of gauging its final challenge rating. (The monster’s actual hit points shouldn’<span class=\"No-Break\">t change.)</span></p><p>For example, a monster with an expected challenge rating of 6, 150 hit points, and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons effectively has 225 hit points (using the 1.5 multiplier for resistances) for the purpose of gauging its final challen<span class=\"No-Break\">ge rating.</span></p><p>Monsters don’t normally have vulnerability to more than one or two types of damage. Vulnerabilities don’t significantly affect a monster’s challenge rating, unless a monster has vulnerabilities to multiple damage types that are prevalent, especially bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. For such a strange monster, reduce its effective hit points by half. Or even better, eliminate the vulnerabilities and give the brittle monster fewer h<span class=\"No-Break\">it points.</span></p><h5>Effective Hit Points Based on Resistances and Immunities</h5><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1834327377\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[WQhPwALIFxIzddLa]{Expected Challenge Rating: HP Multiplier for Resistances}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-1834327376\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[JVdBRqNYaG9p1Qhu]{Expected Challenge Rating: HP Multiplier for Immunities}</span></div></div></div><h4>Step 10. Attack Bonuses</h4><p>A monster’s attack bonuses have a direct bearing on its challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine a monster’s attack bonuses in one of<span class=\"No-Break\"> two ways.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Use the Table.</span></strong> You can start with the monster’s expected challenge rating and use the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine an appropriate attack bonus for all the monster’s attacks, regardless of its abili<span class=\"No-Break\">ty scores.</span></p><p>The table provides the baseline attack bonus for each challenge rating. Feel free to adjust the attack bonus as you see fit to match whatever concept you have in mind. For example, the baseline attack bonus for a challenge rating 1 monster is +3, but if your monster needs more accuracy, raise its bonus accordingly. Don’t worry if the monster’s attack bonus isn’t matching up with the expected challenge rating for the monster. Other factors can affect a monster’s challenge rating, as shown in la<span class=\"No-Break\">ter steps.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Calculate Attack Bonuses.</span></strong> Alternatively, you can calculate a monster’s attack bonuses the same way players calculate the attack bonuses of a <span class=\"No-Break\">character.</span></p><p>When a monster has an action that requires an attack roll, its attack bonus is equal to its proficiency bonus + its Strength or Dexterity modifier. A monster usually applies its Strength modifier to melee attacks and its Dexterity modifier to ranged attacks, although smaller monsters sometimes use Dexterity<span class=\"No-Break\"> for both.</span></p><p>Again, don’t worry if the attack bonuses aren’t matching up with the expected challenge rating for the monster. You can always adjust a monster’s attack bonu<span class=\"No-Break\">ses later.</span></p><h4>Step 11. Damage</h4><p>A monster’s damage output—the amount of damage it deals every round—has a direct bearing on its challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine a monster’s damage output in one of<span class=\"No-Break\"> two ways.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Use the Table.</span></strong> You can start with the monster’s expected challenge rating and use the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine how much damage the monster should deal every round. The table presents a range at each challenge rating. It doesn’t matter how this damage is apportioned or distributed; for example, a monster might deal the damage every round with a single attack, or the damage could be split among multiple attacks against one or <span class=\"No-Break\">more foes.</span></p><p>Choose the type of damage based on how you imagine the damage being delivered. For example, if the monster is attacking with razor-sharp claws, the damage it deals is probably slashing damage. If its claws are poisonous, some portion of the damage might be poison damage instead of slashi<span class=\"No-Break\">ng damage.</span></p><p>If you want the damage output to vary slightly from round to round, you can translate the damage range into a single die expression (for a monster with one attack) or multiple die expressions (for a monster with multiple attacks). For example, a challenge rating 2 monster deals 15–20 damage per round. If you imagine the creature having a Strength of 18 (+4 modifier), you could give it one melee attack that deals 3d8 + 4 (average 17.5) damage, split the damage output into two separate attacks that deal 1d10 + 4 (average 9) damage each, or use any other combination where the average damage output falls within the desi<span class=\"No-Break\">red range.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Base the Damage on the Weapon.</span></strong> Alternatively, you can use a die expression to represent the damage that a monster deals with each of its attacks based on whatever weapon it<span class=\"No-Break\"> is using.</span></p><p>Don’t worry if the damage output isn’t matching up with the expected challenge rating for the monster. Other factors can affect a monster’s challenge rating, as will be discussed in later steps, and you can always adjust a monster’s damage output<span class=\"No-Break\"> later on.</span></p><p>Some monsters use natural weapons, such as claws or tail spikes. Others wield manufacture<span class=\"No-Break\">d weapons.</span></p><p>If a monster has natural weapons, you decide how much damage it deals with those attacks, as well as the type of damage. See the&nbsp;<em>Monster Manual</em>&nbsp;for<span class=\"No-Break\"> examples.</span></p><p>If a monster wields a manufactured weapon, it deals damage appropriate to the weapon. For example, a greataxe in the hands of a Medium monster deals 1d12 slashing damage plus the monster’s Strength modifier, as is normal for th<span class=\"No-Break\">at weapon.</span></p><p>Big monsters typically wield oversized weapons that deal extra dice of damage on a hit. Double the weapon dice if the creature is Large, triple the weapon dice if it’s Huge, and quadruple the weapon dice if it’s Gargantuan. For example, a Huge giant wielding an appropriately sized greataxe deals 3d12 slashing damage (plus its Strength bonus), instead of the no<span class=\"No-Break\">rmal 1d12.</span></p><p>A creature has disadvantage on attack rolls with a weapon that is sized for a larger attacker. You can rule that a weapon sized for an attacker two or more sizes larger is too big for the creature to u<span class=\"No-Break\">se at all.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Overall Damage Output.</span></strong> To determine a monster’s overall damage output, take the average damage it deals with each of its attacks in a round and add them together. If a monster has different attack options, use the monster’s most effective attacks to determine its damage output. For example, a fire giant can make two greatsword attacks or one rock attack in a round. The greatsword attacks deal more damage, so that attack routine determines the fire giant’s dama<span class=\"No-Break\">ge output.</span></p><p>If a monster’s damage output varies from round to round, calculate its damage output each round for the first three rounds of combat, and take the average. For example, a young white dragon has a multiattack routine (one bite attack and two claw attacks) that deals an average of 37 damage each round, as well as a breath weapon that deals 45 damage, or 90 if it hits two targets (and it probably will). In the first three rounds of combat, the dragon will probably get to use its breath weapon once and its multiattack routine twice, so its average damage output for the first three rounds would be (90 + 37 + 37) ÷ 3, or 54 damage (roun<span class=\"No-Break\">ded down).</span></p><p>When calculating a monster’s damage output, also account for special off-turn damage-dealing features, such as auras, reactions, legendary actions, or lair actions. For example, a balor’s Fire Aura deals 10 fire damage to any creature that hits the balor with a melee attack. The aura also deals 10 fire damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the balor at the start of each of the balor’s turns. If you assume that one character in the party is within 5 feet of the balor at all times, hitting it with a melee weapon every round, then the balor’s damage output per round increa<span class=\"No-Break\">ses by 20.</span></p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>ATTACK RIDERS</strong></p>\n<p>Many monsters have attacks that do more than deal damage. Some effects that can be added to an attack to give it a flavorful twis<span class=\"No-Break\">t include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding damage of a different type to <span class=\"No-Break\">the attack</span></li>\n<li>Having the monster grapple the targe<span class=\"No-Break\">t on a hit</span></li>\n<li>Allowing the monster to knock the target pron<span class=\"No-Break\">e on a hit</span></li>\n<li>Imposing a condition on the target if the attack hits and the target fails a sa<span class=\"No-Break\">ving throw</span></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote><h4>Step 12. Save DCs</h4><p>A monster might have an attack or some other trait that requires a target to make a saving throw. The save DCs to resist such effects have a direct bearing on the monster’s challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine save DCs in one of<span class=\"No-Break\"> two ways.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Use the Table.</span></strong> You can start with the monster’s expected challenge rating and use the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine an appropriate save DC for any effect that requires a target to make a sav<span class=\"No-Break\">ing throw.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Calculate the DCs.</span></strong> Alternatively, you can calculate a monster’s save DCs as follows: 8 + the monster’s proficiency bonus + the monster’s relevant ability modifier. You choose the ability that bes<span class=\"No-Break\">t applies.</span></p><p>For example, if the effect is a poison, the relevant ability is probably the monster’s Constitution. If the effect is similar to that of a spell, the relevant ability might be the monster’s Intelligence, Wisdom, or<span class=\"No-Break\"> Charisma.</span></p><p>Don’t worry if the save DCs aren’t matching up with the expected challenge rating for the monster. Other factors can affect a monster’s challenge rating, as shown in later steps, and you can always adjust the save DCs<span class=\"No-Break\"> later on.</span></p><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/910/c9-07.png\"></span></p><h4>Step 13. Special Traits, Actions, and Reactions</h4><p>Some special traits (such as Magic Resistance), special actions (such as Superior Invisibility), and special reactions (such as Parry) can improve a monster’s combat effectiveness and potentially increase its challen<span class=\"No-Break\">ge rating.</span></p><p>The Monster Features table lists various features that you can plunder from the <em><span class=\"italic\">Monster Manual</span></em>. The table notes which features increase a monster’s effective Armor Class, hit points, attack bonus, or damage output for the purpose of determining its challenge rating. (The features don’t actually change the monster’s statistics.) Features that have no effect on a monster’s challenge rating are noted with a<span class=\"No-Break\"> dash (—).</span></p><p>When assigning special traits, actions, or reactions to a monster, keep in mind that not all monsters need them. The more you add, the more complex (and harder to run) the monste<span class=\"No-Break\">r becomes.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Innate Spellcasting and Spellcasting.</span></strong> The impact that the Innate Spellcasting and Spellcasting special traits have on a monster’s challenge rating depends on the spells that the monster can cast. Spells that deal more damage than the monster’s normal attack routine and spells that increase the monster’s AC or hit points need to be accounted for when determining the monster’s final challenge rating. See the “<a title=\"Special Traits\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/mm/introduction#SpecialTraits\">Special Traits</a>” section in the introduction of the <em><span class=\"italic\">Monster Manual</span></em> for more information on these two speci<span class=\"No-Break\">al traits.</span></p><h4>Step 14. Speed</h4><p>Every monster has a walking speed. (Immobile monsters have a walking speed of 0 feet.) In addition to its walking speed, a monster might have one or more other speeds, including a burrowing, climbing, flying, or swimm<span class=\"No-Break\">ing speed.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Flying Monster. </span></strong>Increase the monster’s effective Armor Class by 2 (not its actual AC) if it can fly and deal damage at range and if its expected challenge rating is 10 or lower (higher-level characters have a greater ability to deal with flying c<span class=\"No-Break\">reatures).</span></p><h4>Step 15. Saving Throw Bonuses</h4><p>If you want a monster to be unusually resistant to certain kinds of effects, you can give it a bonus to saving throws tied to a particula<span class=\"No-Break\">r ability.</span></p><p>A saving throw bonus is best used to counteract a low ability score. For example, an undead monster with a low Wisdom score might need a Wisdom saving throw bonus to account for the fact that it’s more difficult to charm, frighten, or turn than its Wisdom would<span class=\"No-Break\"> indicate.</span></p><p>A saving throw bonus is equal to the monster’s proficiency bonus + the monster’s relevant ability<span class=\"No-Break\"> modifier.</span></p><p>A monster with three or more saving throw bonuses has a significant defensive advantage, so its effective AC (not its actual AC) should be raised when determining its challenge rating. If it has three or four bonuses, increase its effective AC by 2. If it has five or more bonuses, increase its effectiv<span class=\"No-Break\">e AC by 4.</span></p><h4>Step 16. Final Challenge Rating</h4><p>At this point, you have all the statistical information you need to calculate the monster’s final challenge rating. This step is identical to step 4 under “Creating Quick Monster Stats.” Calculate the monster’s defensive challenge rating and its offensive challenge rating, then take the average to get its final challen<span class=\"No-Break\">ge rating.</span></p><h4>Step 17. Skill Bonuses</h4><p>If you want a monster to be proficient in a skill, you can give it a bonus equal to its proficiency bonus on ability checks related to that skill. For example, a monster with sharp senses might have a bonus on Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) checks, while a duplicitous monster might have a bonus on Charisma (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Deception\">Deception</a>) checks.</p><p>You can double the proficiency bonus to account for heightened mastery. For example, a doppelganger is so good at deceiving others that its bonus on Charisma (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Deception\">Deception</a>) checks is equal to double its proficiency bonus + its Charisma<span class=\"No-Break\"> modifier.</span></p><p>Skill bonuses have no bearing on a monster’s challen<span class=\"No-Break\">ge rating.</span></p><h4>Step 18. Condition Immunities</h4><p>A monster can be immune to one or more debilitating conditions, and these immunities have no bearing on its challenge rating. For descriptions of the various conditions, see the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/appendix-a-conditions\">Appendices</a> section of the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em>.</p><p>As with damage immunities, condition immunities should be intuitive and logical. For example, it makes sense that a stone golem can’t be <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Poisoned\">poisoned</a>, since it’s a construct without a nervous system or intern<span class=\"No-Break\">al organs.</span></p><h4>Step 19. Senses</h4><p>A monster might have one or more of the following special senses, which are described in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Monster Manual</span></em>: <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Blindsight\">blindsight</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision\">darkvision</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Tremorsense\">tremorsense</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Truesight\">truesight</a>. Whether the monster has special senses or not has no bearing on its challen<span class=\"No-Break\">ge rating.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Passive Perception Score. </span></strong>All monsters have a passive Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) score, which is most often used to determine whether a monster detects approaching or hidden enemies. A monster’s passive Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a>) score is 10 + its Wisdom modifier. If the monster has proficiency in the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\">Perception</a> skill, its score is 10 + its Wisdom (Percepti<span class=\"No-Break\">on) bonus.</span></p><h4>Step 20. Languages</h4><p>Whether a monster can speak a language has no bearing on its challen<span class=\"No-Break\">ge rating.</span></p><p>A monster can master as many spoken languages as you want, although few monsters know more than one or two, and many monsters (beasts in particular) have no spoken language whatsoever.

Apply these modifiers and add these features to the NPC’s stat block, then determine the NPC’s challenge rating just as you would for a monster. Features that can affect a monster’s challenge rating are listed in the Monster Features table. The NPC’s proficiency bonus is determined by its level, just like a character, rather than by its challen<span class=\"No-Break\">ge rating.</span></p><p>If the monster you want to use isn’t listed on the table, use the process described below under “Monsters with<span class=\"No-Break\"> Classes.”</span></p><h3>Monsters with Classes</h3><p>You can use the rules in <a title=\"Classes\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/classes\">chapter 3</a>&nbsp;of the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em> to give class levels to a monster. For example, you can turn an ordinary werewolf into a werewolf with four levels of the barbarian class (such a monster would be expressed as “Werewolf, 4th-level ba<span class=\"No-Break\">rbarian”).</span></p><p>Start with the monster’s stat block. The monster gains all the class features for every class level you add, with the following e<span class=\"No-Break\">xceptions:</span></p><ul>\n<li>The monster doesn’t gain the starting equipment of the ad<span class=\"No-Break\">ded class.</span></li>\n<li>For each class level you add, the monster gains one Hit Die of its normal type (based on its size), ignoring the class’s Hit Die pr<span class=\"No-Break\">ogression.</span></li>\n<li>The monster’s proficiency bonus is based on its challenge rating, not its cla<span class=\"No-Break\">ss levels.</span></li>\n</ul><p>Once you finish adding class levels to a monster, feel free to tweak its ability scores as you see fit (for example, raising the monster’s Intelligence score so that the monster is a more effective wizard), and make whatever other adjustments are needed. You’ll need to recalculate its challenge rating as though you had designed the monster fro<span class=\"No-Break\">m scratch.</span></p><p>Depending on the monster and the number of class levels you add to it, its challenge rating might change very little or increase dramatically. For example, a werewolf that gains four barbarian levels is a much greater threat than it was before. In contrast, the hit points, spells, and other class features that an ancient red dragon gains from five levels of wizard don’t increase its challen<span class=\"No-Break\">ge rating.</span></p><h2>Creating a Spell</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/911/c9-08.png\"></p><p>When creating a new spell, use existing spells as guidelines. Here are some things to<span class=\"No-Break\"> consider:</span></p><ul>\n<li>If a spell is so good that a caster would want to use it all the time, it might be too powerful for <span class=\"No-Break\">its level.</span></li>\n<li>A long duration or large area can make up for a lesser effect, depending on <span class=\"No-Break\">the spell.</span></li>\n<li>Avoid spells that have very limited use, such as one that works only against good dragons. Though such a spell could exist in the world, few characters will bother to learn or prepare it unless they know in advance that doing so will be w<span class=\"No-Break\">orthwhile.</span></li>\n<li>Make sure the spell fits with the identity of the class. Wizards and sorcerers don’t typically have access to healing spells, for example, and adding a healing spell to the wizard class list would step on the cler<span class=\"No-Break\">ic’s turf.</span></li>\n</ul><h3>Spell Damage</h3><p>For any spell that deals damage, use the Spell Damage table to determine approximately how much damage is appropriate given the spell’s level. The table assumes the spell deals half damage on a successful saving throw or a missed attack. If your spell doesn’t deal damage on a successful save, you can increase the damage by 2<span class=\"No-Break\">5 percent.</span></p><p>You can use different damage dice than the ones in the table, provided that the average result is about the same. Doing so can add a little variety to the spell. For example, you could change a cantrip’s damage from 1d10 (average 5.5) to 2d4 (average 5), reducing the maximum damage and making an average result mo<span class=\"No-Break\">re likely.</span></p><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-533402846\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[FsEEAcSStOoszJ9W]{Spell Level: One Target}</span></div></div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-533402845\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[HElrlwxnHkedPKi0]{Spell Level: Multiple Targets}</span></div></div></div><h3>Healing Spells</h3><p>You can also use the Spell Damage table to determine how many hit points a healing spell restores. A cantrip shouldn’t offe<span class=\"No-Break\">r healing.</span></p><h2>Creating a Magic Item</h2><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/912/c9-09.png\"></p><p>The magic items in chapter 7, \"<a title=\"Treasure\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/treasure\">Treasure</a>,\"&nbsp;section are but a few of the magic treasures that characters can discover during their adventures. If your players are seasoned veterans and you want to surprise them, you can either modify an existing item or come up with some<span class=\"No-Break\">thing new.</span></p><h3>Modifying an Item</h3><p>The easiest way to invent a new item is to tweak an existing one. If a paladin uses a flail as her main weapon, you could change a <span class=\"italic\">holy avenger</span> so that it’s a flail instead of a sword. You can turn a <span class=\"italic\">ring of the ram</span> into a wand, or a <span class=\"italic\">cloak of protection</span> into a <span class=\"italic\">circlet of protection</span>, all without altering the item’s p<span class=\"No-Break\">roperties.</span></p><p>Other substitutions are equally easy. An item that deals damage of one type can easily deal damage of another type. A <span class=\"italic\">flame tongue</span> sword could deal lightning damage instead of fire, for example. One capability can replace another, so a <span class=\"italic\">potion of climbing</span> can easily become a <span class=\"italic\">potion o</span><span class=\"No-Break\"><span class=\"italic\">f stealth.</span></span></p><p>You can also modify an item by fusing it with properties from another item. For example, you could combine the effects of a <span class=\"italic\">helm of comprehending languages</span> with those of a <span class=\"italic\">helm of telepathy</span> into a single helmet. This makes the item more powerful (and probably increases its rarity), but it won’t break <span class=\"No-Break\">your game.</span></p><p>Finally, remember the tools that are provided for modifying items in chapter 7, \"<a title=\"Treasure\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/treasure\">Treasure</a>.\" Giving an item an interesting minor property, a quirk, or sentience can alter its flavor sign<span class=\"No-Break\">ificantly.</span></p><h3>Creating a New Item</h3><p>If modifying an item doesn’t quite do the trick, you can create one from scratch. A magic item should either let a character do something he or she couldn’t do before, or improve the character’s ability to do something he or she can do already. For example, the <span class=\"italic\">ring of jumping</span> lets its wearer jump greater distances, thus augmenting what a character can already do. A <span class=\"italic\">ring of the ram</span>, however, gives a character the ability to deal for<span class=\"No-Break\">ce damage.</span></p><p>The simpler your approach, the easier it is for a character to use the item in play. Giving the item charges is fine, especially if it has several different abilities, but simply deciding that an item is always active or can be used a fixed number of times per day is easier <span class=\"No-Break\">to manage.</span></p><h4>Power Level</h4><p>If you make an item that lets a character kill whatever he or she hits with it, that item will likely unbalance your game. On the other hand, an item whose benefit rarely comes into play isn’t much of a reward and probably not worth doling o<span class=\"No-Break\">ut as one.</span></p><p>Use the Magic Item Power by Rarity table as a guide to help you determine how powerful an item should be, based on i<span class=\"No-Break\">ts rarity.</span></p><h5>Magic Item Power by Rarity</h5><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table-2\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Rarity</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Max Spell Level</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Max Bonus</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Common</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Uncommon</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Rare</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Very rare</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Legendary</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">+4</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Maximum Spell Level.</span></strong> This column of the table indicates the highest-level spell effect the item should confer, in the form of a once-per-day or similarly limited property. For example, a common item might confer the benefit of a 1st-level spell once per day (or just once, if it’s consumable). A rare, very rare, or legendary item might allow its possessor to cast a lower-level spell more f<span class=\"No-Break\">requently.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"italic\">Maximum Bonus.</span></strong> If an item delivers a static bonus to AC, attack rolls, saving throws, or ability checks, this column suggests an appropriate bonus based on the item<span class=\"No-Break\">’s rarity.</span></p><h4>Attunement</h4><p>Decide whether the item requires a character to be attuned to it to use its properties. Use these rules of thumb to help y<span class=\"No-Break\">ou decide:</span></p><ul>\n<li>If having all the characters in a party pass an item around to gain its lasting benefits would be disruptive, the item should require a<span class=\"No-Break\">ttunement.</span></li>\n<li>If the item grants a bonus that other items also grant, it’s a good idea to require attunement so that characters don’t try to collect too many of th<span class=\"No-Break\">ose items.</span></li>\n</ul><h2>Creating New Character Options</h2><p>If the options for player characters in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em> don’t meet all the needs of your campaign, consult the following sections for advice on creating new race, class, and backgroun<span class=\"No-Break\">d options.</span></p><h3>Creating a Race or Subrace</h3><p>This section teaches you how to modify existing races, as well as create new ones. The most important step in customizing or designing races for your campaign is to start with the story behind the race or subrace you wish to create. Having a firm idea of a race’s story in your campaign will help you make decisions during the creation process. Ask yourself several <span class=\"No-Break\">questions:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Why does my campaign need the race to be<span class=\"No-Break\"> playable?</span></li>\n<li>What does the race <span class=\"No-Break\">look like?</span></li>\n<li>How would I describe the race’<span class=\"No-Break\">s culture?</span></li>\n<li>Where do the members of this <span class=\"No-Break\">race live?</span></li>\n<li>Are there interesting conflicts built into the race’s history and culture that make the race compelling from a storytelling s<span class=\"No-Break\">tandpoint?</span></li>\n<li>What is the race’s relationship to the other playa<span class=\"No-Break\">ble races?</span></li>\n<li>What classes and backgrounds are well suited to members of<span class=\"No-Break\"> the race?</span></li>\n<li>What are the race’s signatu<span class=\"No-Break\">re traits?</span></li>\n<li>In the case of a new subrace, what sets it apart from the other subraces of the pa<span class=\"No-Break\">rent race?</span></li>\n</ul><p>Compare the race you have in mind with the other race options available to players, to make sure that the new race doesn’t pale in comparison to the existing options (which would result in the race being unpopular) or completely overshadow them (so that players don’t feel as if the other options are <span class=\"No-Break\">inferior).</span></p><p>When the time comes to design the game elements of the race, such as its traits, take a look at the game’s existing races and let them in<span class=\"No-Break\">spire you.</span></p><h4>Cosmetic Alterations</h4><p>A simple way to modify an existing race is to change its appearance. Changes to a race’s appearance need not affect its game elements. For example, you could transform halflings into anthropomorphic mice without changing their racial trai<span class=\"No-Break\">ts at all.</span></p><h4>Cultural Alterations</h4><p>In your world, elves might be desert nomads instead of forest dwellers, halflings might live in cloud cities, and dwarves might be sailors instead of miners. When you change the culture of a race, you can also make minor alterations to the race’s proficiencies and traits to reflect tha<span class=\"No-Break\">t culture.</span></p><p>For example, imagine that the dwarves of your world are seafarers and inventors of gunpowder. You could add the pistol and musket to the list of weapons that dwarves are proficient with, and give them proficiency with waterborne vehicles instead of artisan’s tools. These two small changes tell a different story than the default assumptions about dwarves in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em>, without changing the power level of<span class=\"No-Break\"> the race.</span></p><h4>Creating a New Subrace</h4><p>Creating a new subrace is more involved than making some minor tweaks to existing racial features, but it does have the advantage of increasing the diversity of options for a particular race, rather than replacing some options with o<span class=\"No-Break\">ther ones.</span></p><p>The following example walks through the creation of an elf subrace: the eladrin. This subrace has history in the D&amp;D multiverse, so you already have some stories to draw on when building i<span class=\"No-Break\">ts traits.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/913/c9-10.png\"></p><h4>Example Subrace: Eladrin</h4><p>Creatures of magic with strong ties to nature, eladrin live in the twilight realm of the Feywild. Their cities sometimes cross over to the Material Plane, appearing briefly in mountain valleys or deep forest glades before fading back into th<span class=\"No-Break\">e Feywild.</span></p><p>The elf subraces in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em> include an ability score increase, a weapon training feature, and two or three additional traits. Given the story of the eladrin and their magical nature, an increase to an eladrin character’s Intelligence is appropriate. There’s no need to alter the basic weapon training shared by high elves and w<span class=\"No-Break\">ood elves.</span></p><p>An ability that sets the eladrin apart from other elves is their ability to step through the boundary between the planes, disappearing for a moment before reappearing somewhere else. In the game, this is reflected in a limited use of the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/misty-step\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"misty step\">misty step</a> spell. Since <span class=\"italic\">misty step</span> is a 2nd-level spell, this ability is potent enough that the subrace doesn’t need additional traits. This leaves us with the following features for the eladri<span class=\"No-Break\">n subrace:</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Ability Score Increase. </span></strong>Your Intelligence score incre<span class=\"No-Break\">ases by 1.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Elf Weapon Training. </span></strong>You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, an<span class=\"No-Break\">d longbow.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Fey Step. </span></strong>You can cast the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/misty-step\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"misty step\">misty step</a> spell once using this trait. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or <span class=\"No-Break\">long rest.</span></p><h4>Creating a New Race</h4><p>When creating a race from scratch, begin with the story and proceed from there. Compare your creation to the other races of your world, and borrow freely from the traits of other races. As an example, consider the aasimar, a race similar to the tiefling but with a celestial<span class=\"No-Break\"> heritage.</span></p><h4>Example Race: Aasimar</h4><p>Whereas tieflings have fiendish blood in their veins, aasimar are the descendants of celestial beings. These folk generally appear as glorious humans with lustrous hair, flawless skin, and piercing eyes. Aasimar often attempt to pass as humans in order to right wrongs and defend goodness on the Material Plane without drawing undue attention to their celestial heritage. They strive to fit into society, although they usually rise to the top, becoming revered leaders and honorab<span class=\"No-Break\">le heroes.</span></p><p>You might decide to use the aasimar as a counterpoint to the tiefling race. The two races could even be at odds, reflecting some greater conflict between the forces of good and evil in your<span class=\"No-Break\"> campaign.</span></p><p>Here are our basic goals for th<span class=\"No-Break\">e aasimar:</span></p><ul>\n<li>Aasimar should make effective clerics and<span class=\"No-Break\"> paladins.</span></li>\n<li>Aasimar should be to celestials and humans what tieflings are to fiends a<span class=\"No-Break\">nd humans.</span></li>\n</ul><p>Given that aasimar and tieflings are like two sides of the same coin, the tiefling makes a good starting point for coming up with the new race’s traits. Since we want aasimar to be effective paladins and clerics, it makes sense to improve their Wisdom and Charisma instead of Intelligence and<span class=\"No-Break\"> Charisma.</span></p><p>Like tieflings, aasimar have <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision\">darkvision</a>. Instead of resistance to fire damage, we give them resistance to radiant damage to reflect their celestial nature. However, radiant damage isn’t as common as fire damage, so we give them resistance to necrotic damage as well, making them good at faci<span class=\"No-Break\">ng undead.</span></p><p>The tiefling’s Infernal Legacy trait is a good model for a similar trait to reflect a magical, celestial heritage, replacing the tiefling’s spells with spells of similar levels that more closely match the aasimar’s celestial ancestry. However, the aasimar’s expanded resistance might require limiting this trait to basic utili<span class=\"No-Break\">ty spells.</span></p><p>Filling in the remaining details, we end up with the following racial traits for th<span class=\"No-Break\">e aasimar:</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Ability Score Increase. </span></strong>Your Wisdom score increases by 1, and your Charisma score incre<span class=\"No-Break\">ases by 2.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Age.</span></strong> Aasimar mature at the same rate as humans but live a few yea<span class=\"No-Break\">rs longer.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Alignment. </span></strong>Due to their celestial heritage, aasimar are often good. However, some aasimar fall into evil, rejecting their<span class=\"No-Break\"> heritage.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Size.</span></strong> Aasimar are built like well-proportioned humans. Your size <span class=\"No-Break\">is Medium.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Speed.</span></strong> Your base walking speed i<span class=\"No-Break\">s 30 feet.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision\">Darkvision</a>. </span></strong>Thanks to your celestial heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shade<span class=\"No-Break\">s of gray.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Celestial Resistance.</span></strong> You have resistance to necrotic damage and radia<span class=\"No-Break\">nt damage.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Celestial Legacy.</span></strong> You know the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/light\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"light\">light</a> cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lesser-restoration\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"lesser restoration\">lesser restoration</a> spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Once you reach 5th level, you can cast the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/daylight\" data-type=\"spell\" data-name=\"daylight\">daylight</a> spell once with this trait as a 3rd-level spell, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Languages. </span></strong>You can speak, read, and write Common and <span class=\"No-Break\">Celestial.</span></p><h3>Modifying a Class</h3><p>The classes in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em> capture a wide range of character archetypes, but your campaign world might have need of something more. The following section discusses ways to modify existing classes to better serve your gam<span class=\"No-Break\">e’s needs.</span></p><h4>Changing Proficiencies</h4><p>Changing a class’s proficiencies is a safe and simple way to modify a class to better reflect your world. Swapping out one skill or tool proficiency for another doesn’t make a character any stronger or weaker, but doing so can change the flavor of a class in su<span class=\"No-Break\">btle ways.</span></p><p>For example, a prominent guild of rogues in your world might worship a patron deity, performing secret missions in that deity’s name. To reflect this cultural detail, you could add <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Religion\">Religion</a> to the list of skills that a rogue character can choose as a proficiency. You could even mandate that skill as one of the choices for rogues who belong to t<span class=\"No-Break\">his guild.</span></p><p>You can also change armor and weapon proficiencies to reflect certain aspects of your world. For example, you could decide that the clerics of a particular deity belong to an order that forbids the accumulation of material goods, other than magic items useful for their divine mission. Such clerics carry a staff, but they are forbidden from wearing armor or using weapons other than that staff. To reflect this, you could remove the armor and weapon proficiencies for clerics of this faith, making them proficient with the quarterstaff and nothing else. You could give them a benefit to make up for the loss of proficiencies—something like the monk’s Unarmored Defense class feature, but presented as a divine<span class=\"No-Break\"> blessing.</span></p><p><span class=\"No-Break\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/914/c9-11.png\"></span></p><h4>Changing Spell Lists</h4><p>Modifying a class’s spell list usually has little effect on a character’s power but can change the flavor of a class significantly. In your world, paladins might not swear their oaths to ideals, but instead swear fealty to powerful sorcerers. To capture this story concept, you could build a new paladin spell list with spells meant to protect their masters, drawn from the sorcerer or wizard lists. Suddenly, the paladin feels like a differ<span class=\"No-Break\">ent class.</span></p><p>Be cautious when changing the warlock spell list. Since warlocks regain their spell slots after a short rest, they have the potential to use certain spells more times in a day than other c<span class=\"No-Break\">lasses do.</span></p><h4>Restricting Class Access</h4><p>Without changing the way a class functions, you can root it more firmly in the world by associating the class with a particular race o<span class=\"No-Break\">r culture.</span></p><p>For example, you might decide that bards, sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards represent the magical traditions of four different races or cultures. The bardic colleges might be closed to everyone except elves, dragonborn might be the only creatures capable of becoming sorcerers, and all warlocks in your world might be human. You could break that down still further: bards of the College of Lore could be high elves, and bards of the College of War could be wood elves. Gnomes discovered the school of illusion, so all wizards who specialize in that school are gnomes. Different human cultures produce warlocks with different pacts, and so on. Similarly, different cleric domains might reflect entirely separate religions associated with different races or<span class=\"No-Break\"> cultures.</span></p><p>You decide how flexible you want to be in allowing a player character to break these restrictions. Can a half-elf live among the elves and study their bardic traditions? Can a dwarf stumble into a warlock pact despite having no connection to a culture that normally produces warlocks? As always, it’s better to say yes and use the player’s desire as an opportunity to develop the character’s story and that of your world, rather than shutting down poss<span class=\"No-Break\">ibilities.</span></p><h4>Substituting Class Features</h4><p>If one or more features of a given class don’t exactly fit the theme or tone of your campaign, you can pull them out of the class and replace them with new ones. In doing so, you should strive to make sure that the new options are just as appealing as the ones you are removing, and that the substitute class features contribute to the class’s effectiveness at social interaction, exploration, or combat just as well as those being<span class=\"No-Break\"> replaced.</span></p><p>Ultimately, a class exists to help a player express a particular character concept, and any class feature you replace is also removing an aspect of that character. Substituting a class feature should be done only to fit a specific need for your campaign, or to appeal to a player trying to create a specific kind of character (perhaps one modeled after a character from a novel, TV series, comic book, <span class=\"No-Break\">or movie).</span></p><p>The first step is to figure out what class feature or group of class features you’re going to replace. Then you need to evaluate what each feature provides to the class, so that the features you are adding don’t make the class over- or underpowered. Ask yourself the following questions about a feature you’re <span class=\"No-Break\">replacing:</span></p><ul>\n<li>What impact does replacing the feature have on exploration, social interaction, <span class=\"No-Break\">or combat?</span></li>\n<li>Does replacing the feature affect how long the party can continue adventuring<span class=\"No-Break\"> in a day?</span></li>\n<li>Does the feature consume resources provided elsewhere in <span class=\"No-Break\">the class?</span></li>\n<li>Does the feature work all the time, or is it regained after a short rest, a long rest, or some other lengt<span class=\"No-Break\">h of time?</span></li>\n</ul><p>Armed with answers to these questions, you can start designing new features that replace the ones you are removing. It’s fine if the new class features drift closer to exploration, social interaction, or combat than the ones you are replacing, but be wary of going too far. For example, if you replace an exploration-focused feature with something purely combat focused, you’ve just made that class more powerful in combat, and it could overshadow the other classes in a way that you didn<span class=\"No-Break\">’t intend.</span></p><p>There’s no formula that can tell you how to design new class features. The best place to start is by looking at other class features, or at spells, feats, or any other rules for inspiration. You’re almost certainly going to have some missteps, as features that seem good on the surface fall apart in play. That’s all right. Everything you design will need to be playtested. When introducing new class features, be sure the players using them are comfortable with the fact that you might need to go back and make some changes after seeing the<span class=\"No-Break\">m in play.</span></p><h4>Creating New Class Options</h4><p>Each class has at least one major choice point. Clerics choose a divine domain, fighters choose a martial archetype, wizards choose an arcane tradition, and so forth. Creating a new option doesn’t require you to remove anything from the class, but any new option you add should be compared to existing options to make sure it’s no more or less powerful, yet remains distinctive in flavor. Like anything in class design, be prepared to playtest your ideas and make changes if things aren’t playing out the way you wan<span class=\"No-Break\">t them to.</span></p><p>Once you have the concept for the class option in mind, it’s time to design the specifics. If you’re not sure where to begin, look at the existing options and see what class features they provide. It’s perfectly acceptable for two class options to have similar features, and it’s also fine to look at other classes for examples of mechanics you can draw on for inspiration. As you design each class feature, ask the following <span class=\"No-Break\">questions:</span></p><ul>\n<li>How does the class feature reinforce the story or theme of the cla<span class=\"No-Break\">ss option?</span></li>\n<li>Is there an existing feature that can be used a<span class=\"No-Break\">s a model?</span></li>\n<li>How does the new class feature compare to other features of the s<span class=\"No-Break\">ame level?</span></li>\n</ul><h4>Variant: Spell Points</h4><p>One way to modify how a class feels is to change how it uses its spells. With this variant system, a character who has the Spellcasting feature uses spell points instead of spell slots to fuel spells. Spell points give a caster more flexibility, at the cost of greater c<span class=\"No-Break\">omplexity.</span></p><p>In this variant, each spell has a point cost based on its level. The Spell Point Cost table summarizes the cost in spell points of slots from 1st to 9th level. Cantrips don’t require slots and therefore don’t require spe<span class=\"No-Break\">ll points.</span></p><p>Instead of gaining a number of spell slots to cast your spells from the Spellcasting feature, you gain a pool of spell points instead. You expend a number of spell points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can’t reduce your spell point total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when you finish a <span class=\"No-Break\">long rest.</span></p><p>Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. You can use spell points to create one slot of each level of 6th or higher. You can’t create another slot of the same level until you finish a <span class=\"No-Break\">long rest.</span></p><p>The number of spell points you have to spend is based on your level as a spellcaster, as shown in the Spell Points by Level table. Your level also determines the maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you ca<span class=\"No-Break\">n’t do so.</span></p><p>The Spell Points by Level table applies to bards, clerics, druids, sorcerers, and wizards. For a paladin or ranger, halve the character’s level in that class and then consult the table. For a fighter (Eldritch Knight) or rogue (Arcane Trickster), divide the character’s level in that class<span class=\"No-Break\"> by three.</span></p><p>This system can be applied to monsters that cast spells using spell slots, but it isn’t recommended that you do so. Tracking spell point expenditures for a monster can be<span class=\"No-Break\"> a hassle.</span></p><h5>Spell Point Cost</h5><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Spell Level</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Point Cost</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">13</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h5>Spell Points by Level</h5><div><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table-2\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Class Level</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Spell Points</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Max Spell Level</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">6</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">14</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">17</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">27</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">32</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">38</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">44</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">57</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">64</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">11th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">73</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">6th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">12th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">73</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">6th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">13th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">83</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">7th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">14th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">83</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">7th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">15th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">94</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">8th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">16th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">94</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">8th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">17th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">107</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">9th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">18th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">114</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">9th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">19th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">123</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">9th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">20th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">133</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">9th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h3>Creating a Background</h3><p>A well-crafted background can help a player create a character that feels like an exciting addition to your campaign. It helps define the character’s place in the world, rather than what a character is in terms of game <span class=\"No-Break\">mechanics.</span></p><p>Instead of focusing on a generic character background, such as merchant or wanderer, think about the factions, organizations, and cultures of your campaign and how they might be leveraged to create flavorful backgrounds for player characters. For example, you could create an acolyte of Candlekeep background that is functionally similar to a sage background, but which ties a character more closely to a place and organization in y<span class=\"No-Break\">our world.</span></p><p>A character with the acolyte of Candlekeep background probably has friends among the Avowed—the monks who maintain the great library at Candlekeep. The character can enter the library and consult its lore freely, while others must donate a rare or valuable tome of knowledge before they are allowed entry. Candlekeep’s enemies are the character’s enemies, and its allies, the character’s friends. Acolytes of Candlekeep are generally regarded as learned sages and protectors of knowledge. It’s possible to envision many interesting interactions as NPCs discover the character’s background and approach the character in search of a<span class=\"No-Break\">ssistance.</span></p><p>To create your own background, follow th<span class=\"No-Break\">ese steps.</span></p><h4>Step 1. Root It in Your World</h4><p>To ground a new background in your campaign’s setting, determine what element of your campaign the background is tied to: a faction, an organization, a trade, a person, an event, or a<span class=\"No-Break\"> location.</span></p><h4>Step 2. Suggest Personal Characteristics</h4><p>Create tables of suggested characteristics—personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws—that fit the background, or plunder entries from the tables presented in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em>. Even if your players don’t use the tables, this step helps you paint a picture of the background’s place in your world. The tables need not be extensive; two or three entries per table a<span class=\"No-Break\">re enough.</span></p><h4>Step 3. Assign Proficiencies or Languages</h4><p>Choose two skill proficiencies and two tool proficiencies for the background. You can replace tool proficiencies with languages on a one-for-<span class=\"No-Break\">one basis.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/915/c9-12.png\"></p><h4>Step 4. Include Starting Equipment</h4><p>Make sure your background offers a package of starting equipment. In addition to a small amount of money that a character can use to buy adventuring gear, the starting equipment should include items that a character would have acquired prior to becoming an adventurer, as well as one or two items unique to the b<span class=\"No-Break\">ackground.</span></p><p>For example, starting equipment for a character with the acolyte of Candlekeep background might include a set of traveler’s clothes, a scholar’s robe, five candles, a tinderbox, an empty scroll case engraved with the symbol of Candlekeep, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp. The scroll case might be a gift given to an acolyte of Candlekeep who embarks on a life of adventure. At your discretion, it might also contain a u<span class=\"No-Break\">seful map.</span></p><h4>Step 5. Settle on a Background Feature</h4><p>Choose an existing background feature or create a new one, as you prefer. If you choose an existing feature, add or tweak a few details to make <span class=\"No-Break\">it unique.</span></p><p>For example, the acolyte of Candlekeep background might have the Researcher feature of the sage (as presented in the <em><span class=\"italic\">Player’s Handbook</span></em>), with the additional benefit that the character is allowed to enter Candlekeep without paying the no<span class=\"No-Break\">rmal cost.</span></p><p>A background feature should avoid strict game benefits, such as a bonus to an ability check or an attack roll. Instead, the feature should open up new options for roleplaying, exploring, and otherwise interacting with <span class=\"No-Break\">the world.</span></p><p>For example, the sage’s Researcher feature is designed to send the character on adventures. It doesn’t provide information or an automatic success for a check. Instead, if a character with the sage background fails to recall information, he or she instead knows where to learn it. This might be a pointer to another sage or to a library long lost within an anc<span class=\"No-Break\">ient tomb.</span></p><p>The best background features give characters a reason to strike out on quests, to make contact with NPCs, and to develop bonds to the setting you’v<span class=\"No-Break\">e devised.</span></p>","img":null,"_id":"vYBnNWszePr37CSF"}

Each type of dungeon described in “Dungeon Purpose” section of chapter 5, \"<a title=\"Dungeon Purpose\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/adventure-environments#DungeonPurpose\">Adventure Environments</a>\"&nbsp;has its own table featuring chambers geared to the dungeon’s purpose. For example, if you’re building a tomb, use the Dungeon: Tomb table to help you determine the purpose of each chamber. These dungeon-specific tables are followed by the General Dungeon Chambers table, which you can use if your dungeon isn’t an exact fit for one of the standard types of dungeon or if you want to mix <span class=\"No-Break\">things up.</span></p><p>Relying on random rolls to stock an entire dungeon can lead to incongruous results. A tiny room might end up being identified as a temple, while the huge chamber next door serves as storage.

The Dungeon Chamber Contents table allows you to randomly roll contents for a chamber, or you can choose contents for specific areas. If you choose contents, be sure to include an interesting, colorful assortment of things. In addition to the contents shown on this table, refer to “<a title=\"Dungeon Dressing\" href=\"#DungeonDressing\">Dungeon Dressing</a>” later in this appendix for additional items and elements to f<span class=\"No-Break\">ill rooms.</span></p><p>In the Dungeon Chamber Contents table, a “dominant inhabitant” is a creature that controls an area. Pets and allied creatures are subservient to the dominant inhabitant. “Random creatures” are scavengers or nuisances, usually lone monsters or small groups passing through the area. They include such creatures as carrion crawlers, dire rats, gelatinous cubes, and rust monsters. See chapter 3, \"<a title=\"Creating Adventures\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-adventures\">Creating Adventures</a>\"&nbsp;for more information on random e<span class=\"No-Break\">ncounters.</span></p><h4>Dungeon Chamber Contents</h4><div><div data-type=\"rolltable\" data-id=\"-169422327\"><div class=\"rolltable\"><span class=\"rolltable-head\">Roll Table: </span><span class=\"rolltable-link\">@RollTable[ia4fcaf3nr9uOoOi]{Contents}</span></div></div></div><h3>Monsters and Motivations</h3><p><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/922/c10appendixa-06.png\"></p><p>See chapter 3, “<a title=\"Creating Adventures\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-adventures\">Creating Adventures</a>” for guidance on creating encounters with monsters. To foster variety and suspense, be sure to include encounters of varying d<span class=\"No-Break\">ifficulty.</span></p><p>A powerful creature encountered early in the dungeon sets an exciting tone and forces the adventurers to rely on their wits. For example, an ancient red dragon might slumber on the first level of a dungeon, a pall of smoke and the sound of its heavy breathing filling the chambers near its lair. Clever characters will do their utmost to avoid the dragon, even as the party’s brave thief makes off with a few coins from <span class=\"No-Break\">its hoard.</span></p><p>Not all monsters are automatically hostile. When placing monsters in your dungeon, consider their relationships to nearby creatures and their attitudes toward adventurers. Characters might be able to appease a hungry beast by offering it food, and smarter creatures have complex motivations. The Monster Motivation table lets you use a monster’s goals to define its presence in th<span class=\"No-Break\">e dungeon.</span></p><p>For large groups of monsters encountered across multiple chambers, motivation could apply to the entire group, or each subgroup could have conflict<span class=\"No-Break\">ing goals.</span></p><h4>Monster Motivation</h4><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"dice-column-header\" style=\"text-align: center;\">d20</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Goals</th>\n<th class=\"dice-column-header\" style=\"text-align: center;\">d20</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Goals</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1–2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Find a sanctuary</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">12–13</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Hide from enemies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3–5</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Conquer the dungeon</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">14–15</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Recover from a battle</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6–8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Seek an item in the dungeon</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">16–17</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Avoid danger</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9–11</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Slay a rival</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">18–20</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Seek wealth</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h3>Random Dungeon Hazards</h3><p>Hazards are rarely found in inhabited areas, because monsters either clear them away or a<span class=\"No-Break\">void them.</span></p><p>Shriekers and violet fungi are described in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Manual</em><span class=\"italic\">.</span> The other hazards on the table are described in chapter 5, “<a title=\"Adventure Environments\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/adventure-environments\">Adventure Envi</a><span class=\"No-Break\"><a title=\"Adventure Environments\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/adventure-environments\">ronments</a>.”</span></p><h4>Dungeon Hazards</h4><div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"dice-column-header\" style=\"text-align: center;\">d20</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Hazard</th>\n<th class=\"dice-column-header\" style=\"text-align: center;\">d20</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Hazard</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1–3</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Brown mold</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">11–15</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Spiderwebs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4–8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Green slime</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">16–17</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Violet fungus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9–10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Shrieker</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">18–20</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Yellow mold</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h3>Random Obstacles</h3><p>Obstacles block progress through the dungeon.
